  2. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install); Homebrew installed? `brew install golang`
     - Install claat `go install github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/claat@latest`
     - Ensure go and claat is in your `PATH` [claat path setup](#claat-related-errors)
  3. **Optional**: install the live-reload plugin for Chrome: [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

### Run locally

  2. Clone your new fork `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/sfquickstarts.git sfquickstarts`
  3. Navigate to the site directory `cd sfquickstarts/site`
  4. Install node dependencies `npm install`
  5. Run the site `npm run serve`
  6. Open a browser to http://localhost:8000/

### Common Errors

#### 1. Claat related errors
   - Make sure Go is properly in your `PATH`. Add the following lines to your profile (`~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc`):
````bash
#adding Golang to path
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
````
  ***Note:** After adding Go to your `PATH`, be sure to apply your new profile: `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`*

#### 2. You get a `EACCES` error when installing `gulp-cli`
   - This means that your npm location needs to be updated. Follow the steps here: [Resolve EACCESS permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory)

#### 3. You get `Error: Cannot find module 'postcss'` when running `npm run serve` 
   - The module may not have been installed for some reason so run `npm install --save-dev postcss gulp-postcss` and then rerun `npm run serve` 

## Write Your First Quickstart

  1. Terminate the running server with `ctrl C` and navigate to the `sfguides` source directory `cd sfguides/src`
     - In this directory, you will see all existing guides and their markdown files.
  2. Generate a new guide from the guide template `npm run template <GUIDE_NAME>` 
      - Don't use spaces in the name of your guide, instead use underscores.
  3. Navigate to the newly generated guide (`cd sfguides/src/<GUIDE_NAME>`) and edit your guide in a tool like VS Code.
  4. Run the website again `npm run serve`
  5. As you edit and save changes, your changes will automatically load in the browser.

You can always read the [sample Quickstart](site/sfguides/src/sample/sample.md) online.
