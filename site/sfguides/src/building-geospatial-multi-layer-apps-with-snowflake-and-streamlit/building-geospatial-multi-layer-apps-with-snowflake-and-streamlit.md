# Building Geospatial Multi-Layer Apps with Snowflake and Streamlit
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 10


Welcome to the **Building Geospatial Multi-Lay Apps with Snowflake and Streamlit quickstart**.  Today you will learn how to analyse and transform [geospatial](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/what-is-spatial-data) data in Snowflake.  You will be using **Ordnance Survey** open datasets available on the marketplace as well as the worldwide open overture buildings dataset provided by **CARTO**.

This is a progressive learning experience from viewing points on a mapk right through to building a multi layer app - which pulls together buildings with unique property reference numbers, the road network and urban extents.

You will be covering:

- Geospatial datatypes and formats
- Points, Linestrings and Polygons
- H3
- Spatial Joins and Calculations
- Visualising the results using **Pydeck**
- Search Optimisation
- Building a multi-layer app - which pulls together everything you have learned.

- Using what you have learnt to create a **solar power what if scenario calculator**.  This combines Roofing data and solar elevation data supplied by the **Met Office**

Thoughout the experience, you will demonstrate the concepts with **Snowflake Notebooks** and Streamlit.

### Structure of the session

The Lab consists of three notebooks and two Streamlit applications.

- Completion of the (**ANALYSE_LOCATION_DATA**) notebook. 

    This is an end-to-end tour on how location data works with Snowflake

- Creating a Streamlit app **ROAD_NETWORK**

    This is an example Streamlit application which brings together the different techniques learnt in notebook 1. 



### What You Will Learn

- An understanding of geospatial data types and formats - and how this works in **Snowflake**

- An understanding of Snowflakes built in **H3** capabilities

- Spatial Joins

- Geospatial Calculations

- Geospatial Filtering

- Using Search Optimisation to speed up geospatial queries

- Visualing points, linestrings and polygons on a multi layered map using **Pydeck** - all within a Streamlt application

### What You’ll Build 
- A streamlit application to visualise the UK road network together with buildings - which uses Ordnance survey road network data and the Carto Overture maps buildings dataset.

Run the app

You will be able to select an urban area which will give you summary details as well as the buildings information.  Each building is color coded based on the level of potential energy efficiency.

the side bar will give you more information about the buildings and weather in the selection.

You will note that when you **Run Cortex** it leverages the Anthropic LLM which gives you written analysis about the building with the most potential.

## Conclusion and Resources
Duration: 5
### Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the **Building Geospatial Multi-Layer Apps with Snowflake and Streamlit** Quickstart! Throughout this session, you've explored how Snowflake can be used to analyze and transform geospatial data, combining multiple datasets to generate valuable insights.  

### What You Learned 

- **Fundamentals of Geospatial Analysis in Snowflake**  
  You started by learning how to work with location data in Snowflake, visualizing points on a map and understanding spatial relationships.  

- **Building a Multi-Layer Application**  
  Using Streamlit, you explored how to bring together different layers of geospatial information into an interactive application. 

- You have applied the above techniques to generate a **solar panel insights app**
 

### Next Steps  

With this foundational knowledge, you can extend your analyses by:  

- Integrating additional external datasets, such as demographic or economic data, to enhance decision-making.  
- Experimenting with different visualization techniques to improve data storytelling.  
- Automating geospatial data processing with Snowpark and external APIs.  

We hope this hands-on lab has provided you with the confidence and skills to apply geospatial analytics in your own projects. **Happy analyzing!** 🚀
