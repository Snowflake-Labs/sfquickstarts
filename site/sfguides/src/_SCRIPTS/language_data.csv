The problem this aims to solve is allowing customers to obfuscate (or “mask”) PII while at the same time not losing the ability to use that data in joins and other operations where the consistency of the data through operations is required. Python offers libraries to achieve this using encryption, and through the use of Snowflake Python UDFs we can apply that to information in Snowflake natively.
