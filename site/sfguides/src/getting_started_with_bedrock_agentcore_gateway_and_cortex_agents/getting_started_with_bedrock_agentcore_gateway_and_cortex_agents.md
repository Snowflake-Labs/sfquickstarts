# Getting Started with Bedrock AgentCore Gateways and Cortex Agents
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 10


[Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents) orchestrate across both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver insights. They plan tasks, use tools to execute these tasks, and generate responses. Agents use Cortex Analyst (structured) and Cortex Search (unstructured) as tools, along with LLMs, to analyze data. Cortex Search extracts insights from unstructured sources, while Cortex Analyst generates SQL to process structured data. A comprehensive support for tool identification and tool execution enables delivery of sophisticated applications grounded in enterprise data.


[Bedrock AgentCore Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html) provides a way to turn existing APIs into fully-managed MCP servers without needing to manage infrastructure or hosting. By bringing your OpenAPI specifications, Gateway converts your APIs into tools accessible through the standardized **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** interface.


### Use Case


Users will create an intelligent search system on structured and unstructured movie data using Snowflake Cortex AI and via an AgentCore Gateway. Snowflake Cortex AI will process and index the unstructured movie reviews and structured movie ratings, making them searchable through advanced text analysis. We will then include the Cortex Agent as a target from a Bedrock AgentCore Gateway that can be used alongside other targets as part of a broader Bedrock AgentCore Agent.

The end-to-end workflow will look like this:
![](assets/agentcorearchitecture.png)

Ingest data into structured and unstructured data stores then:
1. Create a Cortex Analyst service with structured data with a Semantic View.
2. Using Snowflake functions prepare the data and create a Cortex Search service with unstructured data.
3. Create a Cortex Agent that brokers the decision on when to use each service (as well as other GenAI functions)
4. A Bedrock AgentCore Gateway Target is created using Secretes Manager to store the Snowflake PAT and connect to the Cortex Agent via OpenAPI.
5. Build a Streamlit App to pass request to Cortex via AgentCore Gateway


### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with [Snowflake](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowflake/index.html#0) and a Snowflake account with Cortex Search.
- Familiarity with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and an AWS account.


### What You'll Learn
- Using Cortex Search along with complimentary functions in Snowflake.
- Using Cortex Analyst and semantic models in Snowflake.
- Using Cortex Agents.
- Using Bedrock AgentCore Gateways with OpenAPI Targets.
- Using Streamlit to build a simple app to serve results of your AgentCore Gateway


### What You’ll Need
- A free [Snowflake Account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) with access to Bedrock AgentCore
- For the sake of the lab it is best if both platforms have access to the public internet and are not in a virtual network
- AWS CLI - [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Python 3.11+ - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Streamlit (local) - [Download Stremlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation)


### What You’ll Build
You will build an end-to-end copilot workflow on unstructured data in Snowflake
- to load data to Snowflake via Snowsight
- to extract unstructured data and create chunks in Snowflake
- to create a Snowflake Cortex Search Service on unstructured data
- to create a semantic view with Cortex Analyst on structured data
- to create a Cortex Agent using the Search and Analyst services
- to create a Bedrock AgentCore Gateway with a Snowflake Cortex Target leveraging AgentCore Identity along with a second target to the Wikipedia API

#### Generate Semantic View

Snowflake's Cortex Analyst is a differentiator in the market and allows Cortex to generate highly accurate SQL and execute it from plain text questions. Let's use the Snowflake UI to quickly generate a Semantic View on the MOVIES_DASHBOARD table.

On the left panel of Snowsight:
- Select **AI & ML > Cortex Analyst**
 Make sure that you are in the role that you are just created so you can select **Create New** in the top right and select **Create New Semantic View**
 ![](assets/startanalyst.png)

- Select **MOVIES.PUBLIC** location and name the Semantic View **MOVIES_SEMANTIC_VIEW** and click Next.
![](assets/analystgettingstarted.png)

- Scroll to MOVIES.PUBLIC.MOVIES_DASHBOARD and select all of the columns and click Next.
![](assets/analystselectcolumns.png)

- In the **connect to Search** screen leave all of the prefilled options as-is and select Next.
![](assets/analystcortexsearch.png)

**Cortex Search is added to the Semantic View for columns with many unique values (like product names), adding Cortex Search Services help pick the right values in queries with greater accuracy.**

You can now look inside of the UI view of the Semantic View and see how the Cortex Analyst wizard used LLMs to generate synonyms and descriptions, users are encouraged to update this to improve the performance of Cortex Analyst. Additionally, for Semantic Views that include multiple tables (most will, but not for this demo :smile) users can define relationships and include certified queries.

**Semantic Synonyms and Descriptions**
![](assets/synonymanddesc.png)

**Verified Queries**
![](assets/verifiedqueries.png)

Underneath the UI Cortex Analyst is simply generating a yaml file, so users can build the Semantic View programmatically or with the UI. 
![](assets/analystyaml.png)


#### Build Cortex Agent

Snowflake Agents allow for many ways to build the Snowflake Agent Object which serves as a spec for the Cortex Agent API.

Ensure that you are in the CORTEX_AGENT_ROLE and select **AIML** then **Agents** on the left panel the select the MOVIES.PUBLIC database and schema.
![](assets/createagent.png)


Select **Create Agent** in the top right. 
- Unselect **Create Agent in Snowflake Intelligence**
- Select the MOVIES.PUBLIC database and schema
- name the agent "MOVIESAGENT"

Select the MOVIES agent you just created and select **Edit**.
- In the **About > Description** section place this sentence, "This agent helps answer questions on a select set of movies."
- In the **Orchestration Instructions** please these instructions, "Return only the final answer for the user, in clean Markdown. No planning text, no status messages, no tool traces, no JSON, no code blocks. Use short sentences. Prefer ‘- ’ bullets (not numbered lists). Avoid headings unless asked. Keep lists ≤ 8 items. Don’t echo the question. If there are no results, say ‘No results.’
You are answering for an external app. Produce concise, well‑formatted Markdown. No preamble, no ‘thinking’, no meta‑commentary, no escaping. Final answer only."
- Select your favorite Claude model (running on Bedrock) and click Save
![](assets/orchestrateagent.png)

With Cortex Agents you can add number of [tools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#tools) including native AI services and custom tools. In this quickstart we are only using 1 Cortex Search service and 1 Cortex Analyst service, but Cortex Agents can scale to be much more complex.
- Select **+ Add** for Cortex Analyst.
- Select the MOVIES.PUBLIC Schema and the MOVIES_SEMANTIC_VIEW that we just created. 
- Provide the name MOVIES_SEMANTIC_VIEW.
- Select **Generate with Cortex**.
- Select **Add**.
![](assets/analysttool.png)


- Select **+ Add** for Cortex Search.
- Provide the name MOVIE_SEARCH.
- Provide MOVIES.PUBLIC for the Search service.
- Select DOCUMENT_ID for the ID Column and SEARCHABLE_TEXT for the Title column.
- Select **Add**.
![](assets/searchtool.png)

Click **Save** in the top right.

The Agent is ready, you can test it out right in the Snowflake UI with a few sample questions.

Now that Snowflake is ready let's work on setting up Snowflake Cortex as a target in an AgentCore Gateway.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
##  AgentCore Gateway
Duration: 10

As a pre-requisite it is expected that users have the below available locally:
- IDE like VS Code (or one of its derivatives).
- AWS CLI and familiarity with it. 
- Installed Python 3.11 or greater.
- Streamlit library installed.

Open a terminal and clone the repo below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-bedrock-agentcore-gateways-and-cortex-agents.git
```

Before we get started please make sure you are connected to your AWS account via the (AWS CLI)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html]

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
cd agentcore-to-cortex

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit requests

python -c "from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit.operations.gateway.client import GatewayClient; print('✅ Installation successful')"
```

### 2. Create Gateway with OpenAPI Target

With the environment ready we are set to create the AgentCore Gateway. Update the below code with your PAT Token from Snowflake and run it. 


```bash
export SNOWFLAKE_PAT_TOKEN="<PAT TOKEN FROM SNOWFLAKE>"

python create_multitarget_gateway.py
```

You should see output affirming the creation of the AWS services like: Gateway, Role, Identity Service and others.

You can now head to your AWS Portal and see what was created.

- In Bedrock AgentCore select **Gateways > Find your Target** and you should see something like below.

### Use the Gateway from a Streamlit App

Last, from the VS Code terminal execute the below code which will open a browser with a Streamlit App.

```bash
pip install streamlit

streamlit run app.py
```

Try clicking one the buttons like **Toy Story Analysis** to populate the request and submit


The app should look like this:

Feel free to make additional requests by using the buttons or asking questions that are relevant to the data.

### Cleanup

Run the below code to remove the underlying AWS resources.

```bash
python cleanup_aws_resources.py
```

## Conclusion and Resources
Duration: 5


This quickstart is just that, a quick way to get you started with using AgentCore Gateways you are encouraged to build upon this by adding more Cortex Tools to your Cortex Agents and more Targets to your AgentCore Gateway.
   - Scale the workflow to a use case with many documents and use a more robust Cortex Search Service.
   - Scale Agents to include more robust Analyst services and multiple tables and a broader Semantic View.
   - Use more targets in your AgentCore Gateway and leverage LLMs in Bedrock AgentCore to coalesce, send request and consolidate a response.


### What You Learned
- How to use Cortex Search along with complimentary functions in Snowflake.
- How to use Cortex Analyst and semantic models in Snowflake.
- How to use Cortex Agents.
- How to use Bedrock AgentCore Gateways with OpenAPI Targets.
- How to use Streamlit to build a simple app to serve results of your AgentCore Gateway

### Troubleshooting

#### Invalid Bearer Token Error

If you see this error or similar:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "list-tools", "error": {"code": -32001, "message": "Invalid Bearer token"}}
```
You will need to refresh your OAuth token from Amazon Cognito to use AgentCore Gateway.

#### Manual Token Refresh

You can create a file with the below contents to refresh the token:

```python
import json
from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit.operations.gateway.client import GatewayClient

# Load settings
with open("settings.json") as f:
    settings = json.load(f)

# Refresh token
client = GatewayClient(region_name=settings["region"])
new_token = client.get_access_token_for_cognito(settings["client_info"])

# Update settings
settings["access_token"] = new_token
with open("settings.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(settings, f, indent=2)

print("Token refreshed!")
```

#### AgentCore Gateway OpenAPI Target

The **OpenAPI schema** (`cortex_agents_openapi.json`) defines the **API contract** between AgentCore Gateway and Snowflake Cortex API:

```python
target_response = client.create_mcp_gateway_target(
    gateway=gateway_response,
    name="SnowflakeCortexTarget",
    target_type="openApiSchema",                    # Tells AgentCore this is an OpenAPI target
    target_payload={"inlinePayload": json.dumps(openapi_schema)}, # Inline schema definition
    credentials={...}
)
```

The OpenAPI schema defines the API endpoint, request and response format, and server variables for the dynamic Snowflake account URL. We provide the Snowflake account information in the test_client directly.

#### OpenAPI Schema Processing flow

1. AgentCore Gateway receives the MCP tool call request from the test_client.py with the provided Snowflake account.
2. AgentCore Gateway validates the request against the OpenAPI schema and processes OpenAPI server variables to construct the target URL.
3. AgentCore Gateway converts MCP format to Snowflake Cortex Agents API format.
4. AgentCore Gateway retrieves credentials from the configured AgentCore Credential Provider and adds authentication headers.
5. AgentCore Gateway makes the HTTP request to the Cortex Agents API. 
6. AgentCore Gateway returns the API response to test_client.py through MCP.
