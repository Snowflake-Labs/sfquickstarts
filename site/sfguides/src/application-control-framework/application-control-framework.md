# Getting Started with the Application Control Framework (ACF)
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 10

This guide will show you how to deploy the ACF and build a demo Native App with controls and limits.

The ACF is an accelerator, allowing you to easily integrate your existing Snowflake application logic into a controllable, auditable Native App. It gives you the ability to dynamically control what logic, functionality, AI/ML, and/or data your consumers receive using rules implemented at either the record or query level, ensuring consumers do not gain access to proprietary information. Once your Native App is installed, the ACF will track and log each consumer’s usage and send that data back to you in near real-time. This allows you to quickly spot any usage or setup issues and rectify them immediately.

The rest of this Snowflake guide walks you through deploying the ACF and demo data/application logic, setting the Native App Limits, listing the demo Native App, and using the app, as a consumer.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with SQL, SnowSQL, Native Apps, Event Tables, and Streamlit

### What You’ll Learn 
- How to create an Event Account
- How to use the ACF Streamlit App (App Control Manager) to set Native App limits and which functionality consumers can access
- How to build and list a demo Native App, using the ACF
- How events are collected and used to update consumer metadata (i.e. the number of records processed)

### What You’ll Need 
- [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql) Installed 
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Installed.  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended.
- Three (3) Snowflake accounts, each with ```ACCOUNTADMIN``` privileges (ideally in the same cloud/region)
  - One account will serve as the main account, where the ACF is deployed
  - One account will serve as an event account, where consumer events from the Native Apps are shared to.
    - The event account uses the Listing API, which is in Public Preview (PuPr).  Visit https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/progaccess/listing-progaccess-about for more information.
    - Once this account is created, it will be set as the event account for the cloud region, by executing the following in the Snowflake Org account, as ```ORGADMIN```
    - ```CALL SYSTEM$SET_EVENT_SHARING_ACCOUNT_FOR_REGION('<REGION>', 'PUBLIC', '<ACCOUNT_NAME>');```
      - The account region can be found by executing ```SELECT CURRENT_REGION();```
      - The account name can be found by executing ```SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME();```
  - One account will serve as a consumer account, to install the demo Native App.

### What You’ll Build 
- A Native App that tracks consumer usage and enforces the limits set in the ACF.

## Downloading the Code
Duration: 3

The code used in this guide is hosted in github. You can download the code as a ZIP from [GitHub](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-application-control-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or use the following git command to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-application-control-framework.git
```

After downloading you will have a folder ```sfguide-application-control-framework``` containing all the code needed to deploy the ACF. Open the folder in VSCode to review the project.

## Event Account Setup
Duration: 5

The first step is to set up an event account for each region the native app will be deployed.  The script referenced below creates an event table (if one has not already been created), streams, tasks, and data listings to share consumer native app events from the event account to the ACF (main) account.

#### Prerequisites

The event account must have been created for each region the native app will be deployed, along with setting each account as the event account for the region. Each event account must be enrolled in the Listing API Private Preview.  Please see the **What You'll Need section for more details.

#### Script Execution

1. The ACF code project includes the ```config/config_events_aws_us_west_2.txt``` file for the event account setup. Update this file, replacing the values in the config file accordingly.  Rename the config file, replacing ```aws_us_west_2```, with your account's region.

##### Configuration Parameters
  - **DIR** - the URI where the ```application_control_framework``` root directory resides on the provider’s local machine.
    - **NOTE:**  The URI formatting differs depending on the provider’s local operating system:
      - Linux/MacOS:
        - The path must include the initial forward slash in the path (e.g. ```/Users/mhenderson/Documents/GitHub```).
        - If the directory path and/or filename includes special characters, the entire URI must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
      - Windows:
        - You must include the drive and backslash in the path (e.g. ```C:\Users\mhenderson\Documents\GitHub```).
        - If the directory path and/or filename includes special characters, the entire file URI must be enclosed in single quotes. Note that the separator character is a forward slash (/) in enclosed URIs (e.g. ```C:\Users\mhenderson\Documents\GitHub Repos``` for a path in Windows that includes a directory named GitHub Repos).
  - **ORG_NAME** - the organization provider’s Snowflake account belongs (this can be found by executing the ```SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME()``` command)
    - **NOTE:**  only required for the config_events.txt file.
  - **ACF_ACCOUNT_NAME** - the name of the provider's Snowflake where the ACF will be deployed (this can be found by executing the ```SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME()``` command).
    - **NOTE:**  only required for the config_events.txt file.
  - **ACF_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR** - the account identifier for provider's Snowflake account where the ACF will be deployed (this can be found by executing the ```SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT()``` command).
  - **EVENTS_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR** - the account identifier for provider's Snowflake account where ACF events will be collected. (this can be found by executing the ```SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT()``` command).
    - **NOTE:**  only required for the config_events.txt file.
  - **APP_CODE** - an abbreviated representation for the name of the app. 
    - **NOTE:** for this QuickStart, please use **SDE**.

**Example Config:**
```bash
DIR=/Users/mhenderson/Documents/GitHub
ORG_NAME=SFPSCOGS
ACF_ACCOUNT_NAME=PS_WLS_COLLAB_PROVIDER
ACF_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR=CDB65519
EVENTS_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR=KDB59543
APP_CODE=SDE
```



2. Using **SnowSQL**, execute the script to set up the event account:  
```bash 
./event_acct/setup/setup.sh config/config_events_<REGION>.txt
```

Where **\<REGION\>** = the cloud/region where the event account is being configured.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## ACF Account Setup
Duration: 5

The second step is to deploy the ACF to the main account.  This account is different from an event account and will be where the ACF will reside and be managed.

The ACF includes all of the objects required to manage ACF functionality.  In addition, this script also deploys the App Control Manager, the Streamlit UI that is used to perform such actions as define custom controls and rules, create app package versions, onboard consumers, etc.

#### Prerequisites

Complete the previous step, **Event Account Setup**.

#### Script Execution

1. The ACF code project includes the ```config/config_acf.txt``` file for the ACF account setup. Update this file, replacing the values in the config file accordingly.

##### Configuration Parameters
  - **DIR** - the URI where the ```application_control_framework``` root directory resides on the provider’s local machine.
    - **NOTE:**  The URI formatting differs depending on the provider’s local operating system:
      - Linux/MacOS:
        - The path must include the initial forward slash in the path (e.g. /Users/mhenderson/Documents/GitHub.
        - If the directory path and/or filename includes special characters, the entire URI must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
      - Windows:
        - You must include the drive and backslash in the path (e.g. C:\Users\mhenderson\Documents\GitHub).
        - If the directory path and/or filename includes special characters, the entire file URI must be enclosed in single quotes. Note that the separator character is a forward slash (/) in enclosed URIs (e.g. 'C:\Users\mhenderson\Documents\GitHub Repos' for a path in Windows that includes a directory named GitHub Repos).
  - **ACF_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR** - the account identifier for provider's Snowflake account where the ACF will be deployed (this can be found by executing the ```SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT()``` command).
  - **APP_CODE** - an abbreviated representation for the name of the app. 
    - **NOTE:** for this QuickStart, please use **SDE**.

**Example Config:**
```bash
DIR=/Users/mhenderson/Documents/GitHub
ACF_ACCOUNT_LOCATOR=CDB65519
APP_CODE=SDE
```

2. Using **SnowSQL**, execute the script to set up the ACF account:  

```bash
./main_acct/setup/setup.sh config/config_acf.txt
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Mount the Event Shares
Duration: 5

Once the ACF has been deployed, the shares from the event account(s) can be mounted in the ACF account.  The following step details how to mount the share from each event account set up from.

#### Prerequisites

Complete the previous step, **ACF Account Setup**.

#### Instructions

1. In the ACF account, log into **Snowsight**.
2. Once logged in, if not at the Snowsight home screen, click the **Back** button, in the top left area of the UI, to open the left navigation menu.

6. Create a stream and tasks to stream events from each mounted event database to the EVENTS_MASTER table.

```sql
USE ROLE P_SDE_ACF_ADMIN;
USE WAREHOUSE P_SDE_ACF_WH;
CALL P_SDE_ACF_DB.EVENTS.STREAM_TO_EVENT_MASTER(TO_ARRAY('<EVENT_DBS>'));
```

**\<EVENT\_DBS\>** = the event database created in **Step 5**.

## Dev Environment Setup
Duration: 2

The ACF also comes with a set of scripts that creates the provider’s dev environment.  This dev environment includes the application logic functions and/or procedures to be included in the Native App.  In addition, the dev environment also includes the objects required to test the application functions/procedures locally, to ensure desired functionality, before building the native app.

#### Prerequisites

Complete the previous step, **Mount the Event Shares**.

#### Script Execution

1. Using **SnowSQL**, execute the script to set up the dev environment in the ACF account:  

```bash
./main_acct/dev_env/setup/setup.sh config/config_acf.txt
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Demo App Setup 
Duration: 2

The ACF also comes with a set of scripts that creates objects in the provider’s dev environment to build a demo data enrichment app.  The demo app includes sample source graph data, a function that can be shared with the consumer, and a stored procedure that enriches consumer data with data from the source graph.

#### Prerequisites

Complete the previous step, **Dev Environment Setup**.

#### Script Execution

1. Using **SnowSQL**, execute the script to set up the dev environment in the ACF account:  

```bash
./main_acct/demo_app/setup/setup.sh config/config_acf.txt
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## App Control Manager
Duration: 5

The ACF includes the App Control Manager, a Streamlit UI available in the provider account. The App Control Manager allows the provider to easily build and manage an app built on the ACF, manage consumers, and remove the ACF if/when desired.

The App Control Manager can be accessed via the following steps:

1. In the ACF account, log into **Snowsight**.
2. Once logged in, if not at the Snowsight home screen, click the **Back** button, in the top left area of the UI, to open the left navigation menu.

![img](assets/provider_back_btn.png)

3. Switch to the **P\_SDE\_ACF\_ADMIN** role, by clicking the drop-down in the bottom left area of the UI, then hovering over the **Switch Role** menu item.

## Build Demo Native App
Duration: 20

The demo app is a simple data enrichment app that enriches a consumer’s dataset with attributes from the provider’s dataset, when the records have the same email address.

### Create the Application Package
The native app’s application package consists of views of the native app’s source data, along with views of the required tables used to enforce the rules defined in the ACF and collect logs/metrics. In this demo, an application package will be created:

1. In the App Control Manager, click **Manage App** >> **App Package** >> **Create**.

![img](assets/provider_acm_app_pkg_create.png)

2. Enter **SDE\_DEMO** in the Application Package Name text field. This name will be prefixed by: ***P\_SDE\_APP\_PKG\_***.
3. Select the **P\_SDE\_SOURCE\_DB\_DEV** database from the Select Database drop-down. 
4. Select the **DATA** schema from the Select Schema drop-down
5. Select the **P\_SDE\_SOURCE\_DB\_DEV\.DATA\.CUSTOMER** table from the Select Table(s)/View(s) drop-down. 
6. Click **Create**.

![img](assets/provider_acm_create_pkg.png)

### Create a Version for the Application Package
Once the application package is created, the application functions/procedures are tied to the application package by creating a version and a patch. In this demo, the App Control Manager will be used to create a new version and patch.

1. In the App Control Manager, click **Manage App** >> **App Package** >> **Versions**.

![img](assets/provider_acm_manage_app_pkg_version.png)

2. Select **P\_SDE\_APP\_PKG\_SDE\_DEMO** from the Select Application Package drop-down.
3. Select **CREATE** from the Create, Patch, or Drop Version drop-down.

## Create the Native App Listing
Duration: 10

Once the application package has a released version and patch, the native app is ready to be privately listed. For instructions on how to create a Private Listing for the native app and add the demo consumer account, visit the **Create a Listing for Your Application** section: [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial#publish-and-install-your-application](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial#publish-and-install-your-application).

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Install the Native App in the Consumer Account
Duration: 5

In the demo consumer account added to the listing created in **Create the Native App Listing** section, install the native app available from the private listing. For instructions on how to install a native app, visit the **Install the Application** section [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial#id6](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial#id6).

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Run the Scripts from the Native App’s Readme
Duration: 5

With each installation, the consumer is barred from using the native app until the consumer has executed a series of commands, including sharing events with the provider. These commands are located in the native app’s Readme.

1. In Snowsight, click **Data Products** >> **Apps**, under the Installed Apps section, click the native app installed in the previous section.

```

**NOTES:**
  - **\<APP\_NAME\>** = the name of the app
  - **\<TABLE\_NAME\>** = the name of the results table entered in.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Additional Test Scenarios
Duration: 10

### Reach the Five Requests Limit Then Increase the Limit
By default, the ACF sets limits of the FREE version of the app to five requests. Once the limit is reached, the app is no longer usable, until the limit is increased by the provider in the App Control Manager.

#### Attempt to Exceed Limit
In the app, make five requests to reach the limit, then attempt a sixth, which will fail. 

![img](assets/consumer_request_exceed_limit.png)

#### Increase the Limit

Once the limit is reached, increase the consumer’s request limit in the App Control Manager. 

1. In the App Control Manager, click **Manage Consumers** >> **Manage**.
2. Select the **Consumer** from the Select Consumer drop-down. The consumer name will have a **FREE\_** prefix, followed by the consumer’s Snowflake account name.
3. Select the **limit** control from the Select Consumer Controls to Update drop-down
4. In the **New Value** field, enter **10**, then press Enter.
5. Click **Update**.

![img](assets/provider_increase_consumer_limit.png)

#### Make a New Request

In the native app in the consumer’s account, attempt to make a new request.  Verify that the request is allowed and is successful.

### Consumer Usage of the App is Blocked, when Disabled

The App Control Manager allows the provider to control a consumer’s access. 

#### Disable the Consumer

In the App Control Manager, disable the consumer. 

1. In the App Control Manager, click **Manage Consumers** >> **Manage**.
2.  Select the **Consumer** from the Select Consumer drop-down. The consumer name will have a **FREE\_** prefix, followed by the consumer’s Snowflake account name.

## Conclusion
Duration: 1

You've performed the following:
- Successfully built and deployed a Native App with consumer controls and limits, set via the ACF.
- Verified that the limits are enforced when the consumer hits the limits set.  
- Updated the limits and verified that they are applied for the consumer in real-time.
- Disabled the consumer in the ACF and verified that the consumer cannot use the app.

To get more comfortable with this solution, continue to toggle the limits set for the consumer, add additional functionality to the native app and set the allowed_procs values accordinglt.

### What we've covered
- How to create an Event Account
- How to use the ACF Streamlit App (App Control Manager) to set Native App limits and which functionality consumers can access
- How to build and list a demo Native App, using the ACF
- How to update consumer metadata and verify that the changes are applied immediately.
