# Getting Started with Cortex Agents and Slack
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 2

Cortex Agents simplify AI-powered data interactions via a REST API, combining hybrid search and accurate SQL generation. They streamline workflows by managing context retrieval, natural language to SQL conversion, and LLM orchestration. Response quality is enhanced with in-line citations, answer abstention, and multi-message context handling. Developers benefit from a single API call integration, real-time streamed responses, and reduced latency for optimized applications.

In this guide, we will see how to integrate the Cortex Agents (*in Public Preview as September 2025*) with Slack.

### Why Cortex Agents?

Business users have typically relied on BI dashboards and reports for data
insights, but these tools often lack flexibility, requiring users to wait on
busy data analysts for updates. Cortex Agents addresses this with a natural
language interface allowing organizations to develop conversational applications. This enables business
users to query data in natural language and get accurate answers in near real
time. 

Learn more about [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents).

### Why Slack?

Slack is a communication and collaboration platform designed to streamline
workplace interactions. It allows teams to organize conversations by channels,
send direct messages, share files, and integrate with other tools for a
seamless workflow. Slack also supports the deployment of bots and apps, making
it a hub for productivity, quick information sharing, and team alignment
across projects.

### Prerequisites

* A Snowflake account in one of these [regions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/aisql#label-cortex-llm-availability). If you do not have an account, register for a [free trial](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_).
* A Slack account with access to a workspace where you can install applications. **_NOTE_** _: Slack recommends using a workspace where you won’t disrupt real work getting done —_[ _you can create a new one for free_](https://slack.com/get-started#create) _._
* Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13

### What You Will Learn

### What You Will Build

Cortex Agents integrated with Slack

## Setup Slack
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 10

Follow instructions in this [step-by-step guide](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-python/getting-started/) to create and set up your barebones Slack application in Python. 

***NOTE: You may skip the section titled “[Sending and responding to actions](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-python/getting-started/#sending-and-responding-to-actions)” because we won’t be using that in our application.***

Before proceeding, please make sure you have the boilerplate Slack application running as shown in the above guide.

```python
@app.message("hello")  
def message_hello(message, say):  
  # say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered  
  say(f"Hey there <@{message['user']}>!")  
  
# Start your app  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
  SocketModeHandler(app, os.environ["SLACK_APP_TOKEN"]).start()
```

## Setup Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 10

### Step 1 

Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack).

### Step 2

In Snowsight, [create a SQL Worksheet](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets-gs?_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg&_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg#create-worksheets-from-a-sql-file) and open [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack/blob/main/setup.sql) to execute all statements in order from top to bottom. This is to to create a database, schema, tables, and load data from AWS S3. And also to create Snowflake managed internal stages for store the semantic model specification file and PDF documents.

> aside positive
> NOTE: At this point, switch your user role in Snowsight to **SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ADMIN**.

### Step 3

Use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-stage-ui#upload-files-onto-a-named-internal-stage) to upload [the semantic model spec file](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack/blob/main/support_tickets_semantic_model.yaml) to the **DASH_AGENT_SLACK.DATA.SEMANTIC_MODELS** stage.

### Step 4

Use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-stage-ui#upload-files-onto-a-named-internal-stage) to upload [PDF documents](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack/tree/main/data) to the **DASH_AGENT_SLACK.DATA.PDFS** stage.

### Step 5

In Snowsight, [create a SQL Worksheet](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets-gs?_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg&_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg#create-worksheets-from-a-sql-file) and open [cortex_search_service.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack/blob/main/cortex_search_service.sql) to execute all statements in order from top to bottom. This is to create a Cortex Search service for getting insights from the PDF documents.

### Step 6

Create [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens#generating-a-programmatic-access-token) for **SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ADMIN** role and make a note/local copy of it. (You will need to paste it later in .env file.)

> IMPORTANT: If you use different names for objects created in this section, be sure to update scripts and code in the following sections accordingly.

## Setup Environment
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 3

### Step 1 

Change or browse to the cloned repo folder **_sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack_** on your local machine and open the contents of the folder in your favorite IDE — like VS Code.

### Step 2

In the same folder, create a new file **.env** and set the following environment variables:

```bash 
ACCOUNT='<your-account-identifier>'
HOST='<your-account-identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com'
DEMO_USER='<your-user-name>'
PAT='<your-personal-access-token>'
AGENT_ENDPOINT='https://<your-org>-<your-account>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v2/databases/snowflake_intelligence/schemas/agents/agents/support_ai:run'
SLACK_APP_TOKEN='<your-slack-app-token>'
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='<your-slack-bot-token>'

#Do Not Modify
WAREHOUSE='dash_agent_wh'
DEMO_USER_ROLE='snowflake_intelligence_admin'
```

### Step 3 

In a terminal window, browse to the same cloned folder **_sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack_** and run the following commands to create Python environment and install the Python packages and dependencies required for the application.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4

Browse to your **Slack App** >> navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** on the left >> scroll down to **Scopes**, and then add `files:write` by clicking on **Add an OAuth Scope** button. This is required by the app to generate, save, and display chart image files.


## Setup Agent
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 5

An agent is an intelligent entity within Snowflake Intelligence that acts on behalf of the user. Agents are configured with specific tools and orchestration logic to answer questions and perform tasks on top of your data. 

Note that you can create multiple agents for various use cases and/or business teams in your organization.

## Test Agent
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 3

Before proceeding, make sure you [test](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack/blob/main/test.py) that the Cortex Agents API endpoint and other env variables in **.env** have been set correctly.

Browse to the cloned folder in VS Code and run `python test.py` in a terminal window.

If you see the output as shown below, then you're good to go.

```bash
======================================================================
🎯 FINAL API RESPONSE:
======================================================================
Here's the breakdown of customer support tickets by service type for Cellular vs Business Internet:The data shows that Cellular service has significantly more support tickets (114) compared to Business Internet (35). This means Cellular accounts for about 76% of the tickets between these two service types, while Business Internet accounts for about 24%.
======================================================================

💾 EXTRACTED 1 SQL QUERIES:
======================================================================

📋 Query 1:
----------------------------------------
WITH __support_tickets AS (
  SELECT
    service_type,
    ticket_id
  FROM dash_db.dash_schema.support_tickets
)
SELECT
  service_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_id) AS ticket_count
FROM __support_tickets
WHERE
  service_type IN ('Cellular', 'Business Internet')
GROUP BY
