# Architecture Pattern: Security - Authentication 

## Overview

Snowflake supports authentication methods that cover a number of
scenarios, ranging from human interactive scenarios,  to programmatic
service-account use cases. Client applications that connect to data
sources like Snowflake typically have their own specifically supported
authentication methods that vary from application to application.
Consider BI tools, for example: Some support SAML 2.0 for single
sign-on, while others don't. 

This document spotlights authentication patterns that support the
following scenarios:

1.  Interactive, SSO authentication for humans
2.  Non-interactive authentication for non-human users, such as
    programmatic accounts and service accounts

### Pattern Series: Security

This guide is part of a series on Security. The guides are:
- [Access to sensitive objects](../security_access_to_sensitive_objects/index.html)
- [Authentication](../security_authentication_pattern/index.html)
- [Network Architecture](../security_network_architecture_pattern/index.html)

### Intended Audience

This document is for Enterprise and Solution Architects who want to understand the connectivity capabilities and best practices of Snowflake and Snowflake Partner technologies. This document is not intended for use by implementation teams, although an implementation example is provided.

### When To Use This Pattern

The patterns in this document satisfy one or more of the following
requirements:

1.  The organization has both cloud and on-prem tools that need to
     authenticate to Snowflake. 
2.  The organization uses an IdP to manage authentication, which
    eliminates the need for users to maintain multiple passwords for
    different systems. 
3.  The organization has service accounts that require an authentication
    method that's more secure than username and password. 
4.  Legal or contractual agreements require the organization to
    implement specific authentication methods. 

### What You'll Learn

How to apply two techniques for authenticating access to Snowflake:
- Federated authentication
- Key pairs

## Pattern Details

Across the three authentication patterns, there are five ways to
authenticate to Snowflake: 

1.  Built-in username/password authentication
    password is stored in the Snowflake USER object and the user
    authenticates with Snowflake. The USER object is  delivered as a
    string, or the password is typed in by the user. This option is not
    as secure as alternative options.
2.  Built-in username/password authentication with multi-factor
    authentication (MFA). 
     multi-factor authentication for security. Note that this option
    only supports Duo MFA.
3.  SSO powered by SAMLv2
    cases.
4.  Key Pair 
    users, such as programmatic access or service accounts.
5.  OAuth 2.0 code grant flow 
    Snowflake data.

Snowflake does not recommend basic, built-in username/password
authentication (option 1) because the alternatives offer better
security. In situations where the only method to define a connection to
an application is the username and password on the connection screen,
Snowflake recommends option 2, multi-factor authentication implemented
through Duo. 

There are human, interactive use cases where federated authentication is
the best supported method. Any SAML 2 compatible IdP can achieve this.
Some partner applications also deliver federated SSO experiences
leveraging OAuth 2.0, however, client application support for federated
authentication varies. SAML 2 is an option in some cases through
Snowflake's "External Browser" mode on the desktop. When a desktop
application is configured to use External Browser mode, a
Snowflake-provided driver opens a new browser tab/window so the user can
authenticate with their IdP credentials.  

Programmatic (non-human) use cases can use built-in service account
passwords to authenticate, but only use this method as a last resort.
Instead, consider key pair authentication combined with a secrets
management solution where the client uses its private key, and Snowflake
uses public keys to decrypt it and authenticate. A third option is
External OAuth, which is the only method that allows for an SSO-based
user credential in the programmatic scenario.

## Pattern Example - OAuth 

Now let's look at two applications, Tableau and Microsoft Power BI,
 that support OAuth. The type of OAuth supported differs and in each
case the client application determines which technology you should use.
We will start with Tableau.

When connecting to Snowflake, Tableau Desktop/Server/Online supports an
SSO-like experience through Snowflake OAuth. This example is appropriate
when customers want to provide an SSO-like experience to their Tableau
user population when accessing Snowflake data. This method prompts user
intervention to grant Tableau access to Snowflake.  An external
authorization server is not required in this scenario. Snowflake acts as
both the Authorization Server and the resource server.  Customers that
manage identity centrally and wish to provide a more secure method of
accessing Snowflake other than username and password will want to use
this pattern. 

When connecting to Snowflake, Microsoft Power BI supports an SSO-like
experience through External OAuth. This scenario is appropriate when
customers want to allow Microsoft Power BI users to connect to Snowflake
using Identity Provider credentials and an OAuth 2.0 implementation.
Customers should take into account that this approach requires Azure AD,
because that is what issues the token for access to Snowflake on behalf
of the user. This approach is appropriate to consider if a customer has
an IdP other than Azure AD. For example, if the customer IdP is Okta or
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure AD takes the user
through the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication
process with the IdP before logging the user into the Power BI service.
This scenario is appropriate when a customer wants to manage identity
centrally and provide a more secure method of accessing Snowflake other
than username and password.

SAML SSO may not be appropriate in cases that involve a customer's
Snowflake administrators. Outages with an IdP may prevent Snowflake
administrators whose passwords are stored in the IdP from logging in to
Snowflake. In this case SAML SSO is not recommended and customers opt to
maintain an administrator with a Snowflake password to manage federated
authentication and troubleshoot any issues that occur.
SAML SSO is also not appropriate if the client applications do not
support that method. Consider evaluating if the application supports an
SSO-like experience similar to Power BI and Tableau. 

Some customers use Cloud Service Provider (CSP) private networking
technologies such as AWS PrivateLink and Azure Private Link with the use
of SAML SSO. This is an appropriate scenario but requires a choice.
Currently customers can only configure single sign-on to either work
with their regular, non-PrivateLink URL, or with the PrivateLink URL.

### Guidance

#### Incompatibilities

1.  As of March 2021, SAML-based SSO can only be used on
    either public or private Snowflake endpoints at one time. This will
    be addressed in future releases. 
2.  As of March 2021, Snowflake only supports a single IdP
    at a time for each Snowflake Account for SSO. 
3.  For SSO the web UI only supports SAML 2.

### Design Principles & Benefits Enabled by this Pattern

The benefit of configuring Snowflake for federated authentication is
users need to log in just once with one set of credentials to get access
to all corporate apps, websites, and data for which they have
permission. This benefits users in the form of simplicity as they do not
have to manage multiple passwords for access to SaaS applications, data,
or websites required to perform their job duties.

The unification of user access management means there is a central
directory to provision and deprovision users. Configuring SSO for
Snowflake with any SAML 2.0 compliant IdP helps customers think of
Snowflake as many other SaaS applications that use this common protocol.


SSO for human interactive use cases must consider the capabilities
supported by Snowflake in concert with the authentication capabilities
of the systems users need to authenticate to Snowflake. This matrix
needs to be considered along with the three scenarios described to
enable SSO for as many systems as possible.

## Pattern Example - Key Pair Authentication 

This pattern example compares when you should use key pair
authentication for non-human users versus when you should use external
OAuth for secure, programmatic access to Snowflake data. This example is
relevant to programmatic or service account requirements that require
access to Snowflake. An evaluation of supported authentication methods
of service accounts and programmatic access requirements helps to
determine which non-human user authentication methods to use with
Snowflake. 

Key pair for authentication of service accounts to Snowflake is an
appropriate example when customers have requirements to not rely on a
third party or for the secret to travel over the wire as part of
authenticating service accounts. The private key can be managed
internally by a customer without relying on cloud-based IdPs, such as
Azure AD or Okta. Secrets not traveling over the wire is a great benefit
of key pair authentication where the private key stays with the customer
and the public key lives in Snowflake. 

An additional example appropriate for key pair authentication is if the
customer wants to remove the management of the secret from the service
account authenticating to Snowflake. With key pair authentication, the
private key does not need to be in the possession of the user. The key
is managed by code and therefore the service account itself is not in
possession of the key. 

This example allows for the aggressive rotation of keys without
disrupting connectivity. Since Snowflake allows for two active public
key values at any time, consider this as part of the pattern. This
example is best used with a secrets management platform like Hashicorp
Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to manage the private
key. 

Key pair authentication is not appropriate in scenarios where existing
key infrastructure is not in place to provide for the protection of
private keys. This method may not be appropriate in large environments
where the ability to distribute and manage keys becomes more
administrative overhead than what the customer is willing to deal with.


External OAuth 2.0 is a supported method for non-human users to access
Snowflake. Customers that seek to allow for SSO-based user credentials
in the programmatic scenario should consider this option. OAuth 2.0 is
appropriate for customers that want to centralize the management of
tokens issued to Snowflake by service accounts to ensure that
programmatic access or access by the service account to Snowflake data
has to go through the External OAuth configured service. Customers with
this requirement may have additional requirements to centralize the
monitoring of authorizations across a number of applications. Customers
that do not wish to pass credentials over the wire or store secrets in
Snowflake will find this method useful.

More specific examples where OAuth is appropriate include embedding
Snowflake into your application where the application requires access to
Snowflake, or if SAML cannot be accomplished because there is a program
that requires access to Snowflake then OAuth is an appropriate pattern.

Customers with centralized monitoring requirements should consider
OAuth. With OAuth, customers can see delegated access to Snowflake and
other applications such as Salesforce in one place. This differs from
key pair in that, if I want to audit users authenticating through key
pair, that answer lives in Snowflake. This model also supports examples
where customers want to deprovision service identities from a
centralized place.

### Guidance 

#### Incompatibilities

1.  Snowflake OAuth is not applicable in the programmatic scenario.
    External OAuth should be used.

### Design Principles & Benefits Enabled by this Pattern

The benefits of configuring Snowflake for Key Pair Authentication
include:

1.  The secret does not travel over the network
2.  The user does not need the private key. 
3.  Snowflake allows for the aggressive rotation of key pairs. The outcome of key pair authentication is that it is more secure than username and password. 

The result of External OAuth authentication is centralized management of
tokens issued to Snowflake, and service accounts or users used
exclusively for programmatic access will only ever be able to use
Snowflake data when going through the External OAuth configured service.
Customers benefit from sessions initiated with Snowflake do not require
a password and only initiate their sessions through external OAuth.

## Conclusion

### What We've Covered

1. Snowflake allows multiple authentication methods
2. Single Sign On and OAuth can be used
3. Service accounts have special considerations in how they should be used, with key-pair authentication providing an option
