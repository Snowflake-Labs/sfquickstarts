# Extracting Insights from Video with Multimodal AI Analysis
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Introduction

Duration: 1

In this guide, we’ll take text-rich videos (instructional content, meetings) and extract still images and audio. In order to perform OCR and speech recognitino using Whisper, we’ll process the images through [Snowflake Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/) using `PARSE_DOCUMENT` and `AI_TRANSCRIBE`. To extract key moments and semantic events we will then process through Qwen2.5-VL on [Snowpark Container Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) (SPCS). Lastly, we will store the analysis from all three models into tables, and allow analytical queries around meeting productivity to be run on the data.

## Overview of Snowpark Container Services

Snowpark Container Services is a fully managed container offering designed to facilitate the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications within the Snowflake ecosystem. This service enables users to run containerized workloads directly within Snowflake, ensuring that data doesn’t need to be moved out of the Snowflake environment for processing. Unlike traditional container orchestration platforms like Docker or Kubernetes, Snowpark Container Services offers an OCI runtime execution environment specifically optimized for Snowflake. This integration allows for the seamless execution of OCI images, leveraging Snowflake’s robust data platform. 

## Preqrequisites

* Basic understanding of Snowflake and containers.


## You'll Learn

1. How to create an application on Snowpark Container Services.
2. How to extend Snowflake Cortex AI with models hosted on Snowpark Container Services.

## You'll Need

* [Snowflake Account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_)

## You'll Build

* A containerized service that processes video to extract key moments for analysis.
  


# Prepare your lab environment

## Set up Snowflake

For this guide, you will only need Snowflake's **Standard Edition** on AWS. You may want to select Enterprise to try out advanced features such as Time Travel, materialized views, or Failover.

Choose **US West (Oregon)** for the AWS Region.

Once you have logged in, create a new Workspace.

To prepare your Snowflake environment, Create a SQL File by selecting `+ Add New` and and selecting `SQL File`. Name the file `setup.sql`.

Copy the contents of [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-extracting-insights-from-video-with-multimodal-ai-analysis/blob/main/setup.sql) into your newly created setup.sql workspace file.





# BEGIN TEMPLATE
## Overview 
Duration: 1 hour

Please use [this markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguides/master/site/sfguides/sample.md) as a template for writing your own Snowflake Quickstarts. This example guide has elements that you will use when writing your own guides, including: code snippet highlighting, downloading files, inserting photos, and more. 

It is important to include on the first page of your guide the following sections: Prerequisites, What you'll learn, What you'll need, and What you'll build. Remember, part of the purpose of a Snowflake Guide is that the reader will have **built** something by the end of the tutorial; this means that actual code needs to be included (not just pseudo-code).

The rest of this Snowflake Guide explains the steps of writing your own guide. 

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to set the metadata for a guide (category, author, id, etc)
- how to set the amount of time each slide will take to finish 
- how to include code snippets 
- how to hyperlink items 
- how to include images 

### What You’ll Need 
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Installed
- [GoLang](https://golang.org/doc/install) Installed

### What You’ll Build 
- A Snowflake Guide

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Metadata Configuration
Duration: 2

It is important to set the correct metadata for your Snowflake Guide. The metadata contains all the information required for listing and publishing your guide and includes the following:


- **summary**: This is a sample Snowflake Guide 
  - This should be a short, 1 sentence description of your guide. This will be visible on the main landing page. 
- **id**: sample 
  - make sure to match the id here with the name of the file, all one word.
- **categories**: data-science 
  - You can have multiple categories, but the first one listed is used for the icon.
- **environments**: web 
  - `web` is default. If this will be published for a specific event or  conference, include it here.
- **status**: Published
  - (`Draft`, `Published`, `Deprecated`, `Hidden`) to indicate the progress and whether the sfguide is ready to be published. `Hidden` implies the sfguide is for restricted use, should be available only by direct URL, and should not appear on the main landing page.
- **feedback link**: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguides/issues
- **tags**: Getting Started, Data Science, Twitter 
  - Add relevant  tags to make your sfguide easily found and SEO friendly.
- **authors**: Daniel Myers 
  - Indicate the author(s) of this specific sfguide.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Creating a Step
Duration: 2

A single sfguide consists of multiple steps. These steps are defined in Markdown using Header 2 tag `##`. 

```markdown
## Step 1 Title
Duration: 3

All the content for the step goes here.

## Step 2 Title
Duration: 1

All the content for the step goes here.
```

To indicate how long each step will take, set the `Duration` under the step title (i.e. `##`) to an integer. The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular step will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total sfguide completion time is calculated automatically for you and will be displayed on the landing page.
