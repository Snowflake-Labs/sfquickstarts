# Call Center Analytics with AI_TRANSCRIBE and Cortex Agents
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 10

Audio files in call centers offer rich insights beyond text. With Snowflake Cortex Functions and native capabilities, you can quickly transcribe audio files, extract summaries of calls, sentiment, and patterns which can eventually help in enhancing customer experiences. By transcribing audio to text and developing custom analytics, call centers and supervisors gain actionable insights on agent responses and proactive issue resolution, ultimately driving better customer satisfaction.

In this quickstart, you focus on a scenario where you are a supervisor in a vehicle insurance call center company. As a supervisor, you need to identify metrics about agents and track key metrics like total number of call resolutions and overall call sentiment. With Snowflake Cortex functions, supervisors can get all these details through a Streamlit App with natural language querying capabilities.

This Quickstart will cover essential ground, and by the end you will have built an AI application for call center analytics.

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Python
* Familiarity with Snowflake
* Snowflake account

### What You'll Learn

You will learn about the following Snowflake features during this Quickstart:

* **AI_TRANSCRIBE Function**: Convert audio files to text using Snowflake's native speech-to-text with 40+ language support
* **Cortex LLM Functions**: Extract insights using COMPLETE, SENTIMENT, and SUMMARIZE functions for comprehensive call analysis
* **Cortex Agents**: Orchestrate between structured and unstructured data sources with intelligent planning and tool selection
* **Cortex Analyst**: Enable natural language to SQL conversion for structured data queries without writing code
* **Cortex Search**: Implement semantic search across unstructured call transcripts and documents
* **Streamlit in Snowflake**: Quickly build applications within Snowflake containing key Cortex features

### What You'll Need

You will need the following things before beginning:

* Snowflake account in a cloud region where Snowflake Cortex functions are [supported](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions#availability) or [cross-region inference](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cross-region-inference#label-use-cross-region-inference) enabled on the account.
* **A Snowflake user created with ACCOUNTADMIN permissions**

### What You'll Build

During this Quickstart you will accomplish the following:

* Set up call center analytics database and objects
* Process audio transcriptions using AI_TRANSCRIBE and extract insights using Cortex LLM functions
* Configure [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) and [Cortex Analyst](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst) for intelligent transcript search and production-grade conversational self-service analytics

## Setup

Duration: 5

### Run Setup SQL

First, run the setup SQL script located [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/call-center-analytics-with-aitranscribe-and-cortex-agents/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) to create all necessary database objects, tables, and configurations for the call center analytics solution. This will create:
- Database and analytics schema for call center analytics
- Audio file stage for mp3 uploads
- Custom role with appropriate permissions for AI_TRANSCRIBE and Cortex functions

### Upload Audio Files

After running the setup script (which automatically grants you the `call_center_analytics_role`):

1. **Download example MP3 files** located [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/call-center-analytics-with-aitranscribe-and-cortex-agents/tree/main/scripts/audio_files). Tip: Download the zip from the repository root to get the full folder. 
2. **Upload the files** to the `call_center_analytics_db.analytics.audio_files` stage for processing with AI_TRANSCRIBE. You can access the stage by going to Databases > `call_center_analytics_db` > `analytics` schema > `audio_files` stage >

4. Upload the `call_center_analytics.ipynb` notebook
5. Select the call center analytics database and analytics schema, and call center warehouse
6. Run all cells in the notebook

![transcribe-notebook](assets/ai-transcribe.png)

The notebook demonstrates the power of **Snowflake's AI_TRANSCRIBE function** and **Cortex LLM capabilities**:

#### AI_TRANSCRIBE Function
Snowflake's native speech-to-text capability for processing call center audio files.

- **High-Quality Transcription**: Uses latest AI models for accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports 40+ languages including English, Spanish, French, German, and many others
- **Stage Integration**: Works seamlessly with Snowflake internal/external stages using `TO_FILE()` function
- **Batch Processing**: Can process multiple audio files efficiently using directory tables

**Usage Example**:
```sql
-- Single file transcription
SELECT AI_TRANSCRIBE(TO_FILE('@audio_stage/call_001.mp3'));

-- Batch transcription from stage
CREATE TABLE audio_files AS 
  (SELECT TO_FILE('@audio_stage', RELATIVE_PATH) AS audio_file 
   FROM DIRECTORY(@audio_stage));
SELECT AI_TRANSCRIBE(audio_file) FROM audio_files;
```

**Key Specifications**:
- Maximum file size: 700 MB
- Maximum audio duration: 90 minutes  
- Supported formats: .mp3 and .wav files
- Available across major cloud regions

#### Cortex LLM Functions Processing
The notebook uses multiple Cortex functions to extract insights:
