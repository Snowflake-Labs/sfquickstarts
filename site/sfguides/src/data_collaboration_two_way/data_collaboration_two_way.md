# Two Way Data Collaboration
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

This guide will take you through Snowflake's Collaboration features, and highlight how easy it is to share data between two organisations.

It also highlights Snowflakes ability to host a ML Model, score data from shared data, and share the enriched (scored) data back to the original Provider. Hence, it is a 2-way sharing relationship, where both accounts are Providers and Consumers.
