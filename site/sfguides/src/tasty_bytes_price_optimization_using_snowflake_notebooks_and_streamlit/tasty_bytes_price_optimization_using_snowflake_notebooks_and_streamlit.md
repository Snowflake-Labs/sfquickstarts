# Price Optimization Using Snowflake Notebooks and Streamlit in Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview
Duration: 2
<img src="assets/price_optimization_header.png"/>

Tasty Bytes, a fictitious company, is one of the largest food truck networks in the world with localized menu options spread across 15 food truck brands globally. Tasty Bytes is aiming to achieve 25% YoY sales growth over 5 years. Price optimization enables Tasty Bytes to achieve this goal by determining the right prices for their menu items to maximize profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction. 

In this Quickstart, we will train & deploy an ML model which leverages historical menu-item sale data to understand how menu-item demand changes with varying price. By utilizing this trained model, we would recommend the optimal day of week prices for all menu-items for the upcoming month to our food-truck brands. Afterward, we will showcase an application that can be built and deployed to allow business users to submit data into Snowflake and interact directly with an ML model.

### What You Will Build
You will build a Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) application that will show the recommended price per item per day-of-week and the profit lift over the current price. We will allow users to change prices and see the impact on demand and profit.

### What You Will Learn
We will implement price optimization for their diversified food-truck brands to inform their pricing and promotions by utilizing **Snowflake Notebooks** and **Streamlit** to:
- Train & deploy an ML model to understand how menu-item demand changes with varying price
- Create a user-friendly application to use deployed ML-model to inform pricing strategies

### Prerequisites
- A Supported Snowflake [Browser](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/setup#browser-requirements)
- A Snowflake Account
    - If you do not have a Snowflake Account, please [**sign up for a Free 30 Day Trial Account**](https://signup.snowflake.com/). When signing up, please make sure to select **Enterprise** edition. You can choose any AWS or Azure [Snowflake Region](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-regions).

## Setting up Data in Snowflake
Duration: 5

### Overview
You will use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#), the Snowflake web interface to:
- Create Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema, raw tables)
- Ingest data from S3 to raw tables

#### Creating Objects, Loading Data, and Joining Data
- Navigate to Worksheets, click `+` in the top-right corner to create a new Worksheet, and choose `SQL Worksheet`
<img src="assets/run_all.png"/>
- Copy and paste the [tb_po_setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-price-optimization-using-snowflake-notebooks-and-streamlit/blob/main/scripts/sql/tb_po_setup.sql) setup script to create the Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema, raw tables), and ingest the data from S3 and click `Run All` at the top of the Worksheet

## Machine Learning With Snowpark
Duration: 10

### Overview
At Tasty Bytes, brand managers are responsible for setting their food-truck brand's menu item prices for the upcoming month. By default, price for the upcoming month is set to the current price. As Tasty Byte Data Scientists, we want to create a user-friendly way for brand managers to use ML-models to inform their pricing and increase the company's profits.
- You are tasked as Tasty Bytes Data Scientist to perform the following:
  - **Data Exploration**
    - Connect to Snowflake
    - Snowpark DataFrame API
  - **Feature Engineering**
    - Window & Aggregate functions
    - Imputation and train/test split
  - **Model Training & Deployment**
    - Train Snowpark ML model
    - Register model on Model Registry
  - **Model Utilization**
    - Stored procedure to utilize deployed model
    - Elastic scalability
    - Data Driven Insights
  - **Describe Current Pricing Process**
    - Import an Excel spreadsheet and inference the demand model
    - Calculate profit lift from new prices

### Setting Up Snowflake Notebook
You will use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#), the Snowflake web interface, to create a Snowflake Notebook by importing the notebook
- Navigate to Notebooks in [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#) by clicking on `Projects` `->` `Notebook`
- Switch Role to `TB_PO_DATA_SCIENTIST`
- Download the [0_start_here.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-price-optimization-using-snowflake-notebooks-and-streamlit/blob/main/notebooks/0_start_here.ipynb) Notebook
- Using the `Import .ipynb file`, import the downloaded notebook

<img src="assets/import_notebook.png"/>

- Select the `TB_PO_PROD` database and `ANALYTICS` schema for the Notebook Location and `TB_PO_DS_WH` for the Notebook warehouse and click `Create`

<img src="assets/notebook_settings.png"/>

- Open the Notebook once created and add the following packages by using the `Packages` button on the top right and search for the packages with their respective versions:
    - `ipywidgets` version `Latest`
    - `matplotlib` version `3.7.2`
    - `numpy` version `1.24.3`
    - `openpyxl` version `Latest`
    - `scikit-learn` version `1.2.2`
    - `seaborn` version `Latest`
    - `shap` version `Latest`
    - `seaborn` version `Latest`
    - `snowflake-ml-python` version `1.4.0`
    - `xgboost` version `1.7.3`

<img src="assets/notebook_packages.png"/>

- At the top of the page, click `Start` to start the Notebook session and run the cells by clicking `Run All`

## Streamlit in Snowflake
Duration: 5

### Overview
At Tasty Bytes, brand managers are responsible for setting their food-truck brand's menu item prices for the upcoming month. 
By default, price for the upcoming month is set to the current price. As Tasty Bytes Data Scientists, we want to create a user-friendly way for brand managers to use ML-models to inform their pricing and increase the company's profits. We will build a Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) application that will show the recommended price per item per day-of-week and the profit lift over the current price. We will allow users to change prices and see the impact on demand and profit. Finalized prices will be saved back to Snowflake. The app will be secure and low-maintenance as it will be deployed through Snowflake.

### Purpose
**The purpose of this final step is to showcase how easily an application can be built and deployed to allow business users to submit data into Snowflake and interact directly with a ML model.** We will build a Streamlit App on the fly in Snowflake to support Tasty Bytes' brand managers in deciding monthly pricing.
- **Build an Application to Set Pricing and Interact with Recommendations**
  - View and edit pricing data
  - Show impact of price changes
  - Write changes back to Snowflake
- **Application Deployment**
  - Share the application in Snowflake with the brand managers

#### Create Streamlit Application
- Within Snowsight, Click on the `Streamlit` tab
- Switch Role to `TB_PO_DATA_SCIENTIST`
- Click on `+Streamlit App` to create a new Streamlit application
- Name the Streamlit application "Monthly Pricing App"
- Select the `TB_PO_PROD` database and `ANALYTICS` schema for the Streamlit application location and `TB_PO_APP_WH` for the warehouse and click `Create`

<img src="assets/streamlit_settings.png"/>

- This will create a sample Streamlit Application
- Click on Packages in the top left corner and search for `snowflake-ml-python` and add version `1.4.0`

<img src="assets/streamlit_packages.png"/>

- Replace the sample code with the Python code below
- Click `Run` to run the "Application Monthly Pricing App" Streamlit Application
- This application shows the recommended price per item per day-of-week and the profit lift over the current price. Users can change prices and see the impact on demand and profit. Finalized prices are saved back to Snowflake.
