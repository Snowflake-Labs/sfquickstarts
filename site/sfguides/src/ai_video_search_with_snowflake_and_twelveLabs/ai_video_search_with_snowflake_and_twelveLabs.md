# AI Video Search with Snowflake and Twelve Labs
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 4

This guide outlines the process for creating a video search and summarization workflow in Snowflake Notebook on Container Runtime. Videos stored in the cloud storage are processed to generate embeddings using the Twelve Labs API, with parallelization achieved through a Snowpark Python User Defined Table Function (UDTF). These embeddings are stored in a Snowflake table using the VECTOR datatype, enabling efficient similarity searches with VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY. Text queries are converted into embeddings using the same API to find the top N matching video clips. Audio from these clips is extracted using MoviePy and transcribed with Whisper. Finally, Cortex Complete is used to summarize the results, including video details, timestamps, and transcripts.

### What is Container Runtime? 

Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime enable advanced data science and machine learning workflows directly within Snowflake. Powered by Snowpark Container Services, it provides a flexible environment to build and operationalize various workloads, especially those requiring Python packages from multiple sources and powerful compute resources, including CPUs and GPUs. With this Snowflake-native experience, you can train models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and execute batch inference while seamlessly running SQL queries. Unlike virtual warehouses, Container Runtime for ML offers greater flexibility and tailored compute options for complex workloads. ***NOTE: This feature is currently in Public Preview.***

## Run Notebook

Duration: 15

> aside negative
> PREREQUISITE: Successful completion of steps outlined under **Setup**.

Here's the code walkthrough of the [Gen_AI_Video_Search.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ai-video-search-with-snowflake-and-twelveLabs/blob/main/Gen_AI_Video_Search.ipynb) notebook that you downloaded and imported into your Snowflake account.

**Cell 1:** Install Python packages and other libraries

**Cell 2:** Import installed libraries

**Cell 3:** This is where we provide a list of publicly accessible URLs of videos.  *NOTE: In this guide, three sample videos have been provided.*

**Cell 4:** Create and register `create_video_embeddings` Snowpark Python User Defined Table Function (UDTF) for creating embeddings for the videos using Twelve Labs.

Things to note in the UDTF:

* `session.add_import('@"DASH_DB"."DASH_SCHEMA"."DASH_PKGS"/twelvelabs.zip')` adds the **twelvelabs** Python package that will create the video embeddings
* `packages=['httpx','pydantic']` adds the additional packages required and also readily available in the Snowflake Anaconda channel
* `external_access_integrations=['twelvelabs_access_integration'],` and `secrets={'cred': 'twelve_labs_api'}` adds the external access integration and the twelvelabs API (secret) that will authorize the UDTF to securely access Twelve Labs account to create the video embeddings
*  `    output_schema=StructType([
        StructField("embedding", VectorType(float,1024)),
        StructField("start_offset_sec", FloatType()),
        StructField("end_offset_sec", FloatType()),
        StructField("embedding_scope", StringType())
    ])` defines the schema with columns and their datatypes that will be the output of this UDTF. Notice the **VectorType** of the `embedding` column

**Cell 5:** Create a Snowpark DataFrame using the list of videos and for each video call `create_video_embeddings` UDTF to generate embeddings. Note that the parallel processing of each video is achieved by `.over(partition_by="url")`. Then, save those embeddings in a Snowflake table called `video_embeddings`.

**Cell 6:** Download open source `whisper` model and define the following Python functions:
    * download_video
    * extract_audio_from_video
    * transcribe_with_whisper
    * transcribe_video
    * transcribe_video_clip

**Cell 7:** Replace `tlk_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your Twelve Labs API Key. Here we define Python function `similarity_scores` that uses Twelve Labs to create embeddings for a given text -- *entered_text* passed in as a parameter. Then, similarity scores are generated using Snowflake function **VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY** between text embeddings and video embeddings stored in `video_embeddings` table. This function returns top *N* records (based on *max_results* passed in as a parameter) with columns VIDEO_URL, START_OFFSET_SEC, END_OFFSET_SEC, and SIMILARITY_SCORE.

**Cell 8:** Streamlit application that takes **Search Text**, **Max Results**, and **Summary LLM** as user input. Then, it first calls `similarity_scores` function to get top *N* video clip records along with their similarity scores. For each clip, it then calls `transcribe_video_clip` function passing in its VIDEO_URL, START_OFFSET_SEC, END_OFFSET_SEC to generate the clip transcription. Finally, it calls `snowflake.cortex.Complete` to summarize the output.

### Search Examples

For all search results, the app displays the URL of the video, the clip start and end times, similarity score generated by VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY, clip transcript generated by open source whisper model, as well as the summary generated by Snowflake Cortex.

In all of the following examples, notice the highlighted clip start and end times as well as the timestamps in the respective videos.

#### Example 1

**Search text**: `snowflake intelligence`

![Search blender foundation](search_snowflake_intelligence.png)

![Clip snowflake intelligence](clip_snowflake_intelligence.png)

---

#### Example 2

**Search text**: `blender foundation`

![Search blender foundation](search_blender_foundation.png)

![Clip blender foundation](clip_blender_foundation.png)

---

#### Example 3

**Search text**: `bunny`

![Search bunny](search_bunny.png)

![Clip blender foundation](clip_bunny.png)
