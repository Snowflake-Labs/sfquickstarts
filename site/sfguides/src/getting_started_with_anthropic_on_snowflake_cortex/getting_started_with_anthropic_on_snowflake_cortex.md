# Getting Started with Anthropic on Snowflake Cortex

## Overview

Duration: 5

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to build an RAG-based (Retrieval Augmented Generation)  application that creates an intelligent assistant for documents and other text-based knowledge. The application uses Anthropic's Claude Large Language Model (LLM),  in [Snowflake's Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/cortex/) alongside Cortex Search and Streamlit. The application addresses end-to-end RAG development to show how to do PDF processing, vector embeddings, retrieval and generation all inside Snowflake to enable natural language interactions with your documents through Claude's advanced language understanding capabilities all with unified governance across the application full-stack.

### What You'll Learn

- Data pipeline: Setting up PDF processing in Snowflake using Cortex Parse Document  
- Vector search/index: Utilizing Cortex Search Service for hybrid (semantic and keyword) search  
- Generation: Deliver answers to chat app with Anthropic's Claude  
- Front End: Developing an interactive chat interface using Streamlit

### What You'll Build

An end-to-end application that enables users to:

- Upload and process PDF documents  
- Search through documents using a hybrid search (vector and keyword) similarity  
- Engage in conversational Q\&A about document content  
- View source documents for responses  
- Maintain chat history for contextual conversations

### Prerequisites

- Snowflake account in [AWS US West 2 (Oregon)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions#label-cortex-llm-availability) . To use Anthropic from another region please enable [cross-region inference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cross-region-inference).  
- Account must have these features enabled:  
  - [Snowflake Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks)  
  - [Anaconda Packages](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-packages#using-third-party-packages-from-anaconda)  
  - [Cortex LLM Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/complete-snowflake-cortex)  
  - [Streamlit in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)

## Setup

Duration: 10

> aside negative 
> NOTE: If you are new to Snowflake, you may be wondering why you need to think about database and schemas to get started. Because Snowflake was built with data as the foundational asset that powers projects, these two things are used to organize and manage access and governance to data in Snowflake. You can learn more about how you can use and manage these in our [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/ddl-database). 
> 
> For this app, let’s assume we will give users of the app access to all the documents that are stored in a stage (the location where a raw data file is stored). Let’s create a stage where documents are stored and then let’s create a database and schema, both with the same name, where we will store the AI-ready (parsed and chunked) documents.  

### Create Database and Schema

Create a new database and schema for your project:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS anthropic_rag;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS anthropic_rag;
```

### Create Table for Text on the Documents

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DOCS_TEXT_TABLE (
   FILE_NAME STRING,
   TEXT STRING
);
```

### Create Document Storage Stage

Create a stage to store your PDF documents:

```sql
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS Documents
  ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE')
  DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = true);
```

## Upload Documents

## Environment Setup

Duration: 5

- `snowflake-ml-python`: For Snowflake Cortex capabilities
- `snowflake`: For Snowflake capabilities

```py
# Import python packages
import pandas as pd
import json

from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
from snowflake.cortex import Complete, EmbedText768
from snowflake.snowpark.types import VectorType, FloatType
from snowflake.core.table import Table, TableColumn
from snowflake.core import CreateMode, Root
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import cast, col


session = get_active_session()
current_warehouse = session.get_current_warehouse()
database_name = session.get_current_database()
schema_name = session.get_current_schema()
role_name = session.get_current_role()
service_name = 'document_search_service'
root = Root(session)
database = root.databases[database_name]
schema = database.schemas[schema_name]
```

## Implement Document Processing

Duration: 15

### Understanding Document Processing Flow

Before diving into the code, let's understand the key components of document processing:

The implementation uses Cortex Parse Document to extract text from PDFs and process them efficiently:

1. Document Parsing:
   - Uses Snowflake Cortex Parse Document
   - Handles PDF extraction automatically
   - Manages OCR when needed
   - Structures output consistently

2. Data Organization:
   - Stores raw text with file references
   - Prepares for search service creation
   - Maintains document traceability

### Code Implementation

```py
def process(file_name: str):
    query = """
        SELECT TO_VARCHAR(
            SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT(
                ?,
                ?,
                {'mode': 'OCR'}):content
        ) AS OCR;
    """

    resp = session.sql(query, params=[stage_name, file_name]).collect()
    text = resp[0]['OCR']
    
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'TEXT' : [text],
        'FILE_NAME': file_name
    })
    
    return df
```

## Process Documents

Duration: 10

### Understanding the Process

While you could run your own embedding, index management and search using Snowflake Cortex embed function, vector data type support and vector similarity functions, we are going to build this using [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview#cortex-search-for-rag) \- a RAG engine that automates the embedding/vector generation and management and provides a built-in hybrid search to enhance result accuracy vs. semantic search alone. 

The embedding process transforms text chunks into vector representations for semantic search. Here's what happens in each step:

Document Processing:
   - Extract text from documents
   - Structure data in DataFrame
   - Load into text table


### Code Implementation

```py
# Extract file names and process files
file_names = [file['name'].split('/')[1] for file in files]

# Download and process files into a DataFrame
final_dataframe = pd.concat([
    process(file_name)
    for file_name in file_names
], ignore_index=True)

snowpark_df = session.create_dataframe(final_dataframe).select(
    col("file_name"),
    col("text")
)

# Write the transformed data directly to the target table
snowpark_df.write.mode("overwrite").save_as_table("docs_text_table")
```
## Create Cortex Search Service 
### Understanding the Service
Search Service:
   - Creates hybrid search capability
   - Manages embeddings automatically
   - Enables both semantic and keyword search

### Key Components Explained 📚

#### Required Parameters

- `ON`: Specifies the column containing the text to be indexed  
- `ATTRIBUTES`: Additional columns to include in search results (e.g., file\_name)  
- `WAREHOUSE`: Compute warehouse for processing the embeddings  
- `TARGET_LAG`: Maximum allowed lag for index updates  
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: Model used to generate text embeddings  
- Source query: The SELECT statement defining the data to index

#### Configuration Options 🔧

1. Target Lag Settings:  
     
   - Shorter lag times mean more frequent updates  
   - Common values: '1 hour', '1 day', '1 week'  
   - Balance freshness needs with compute costs

   

2. Embedding Model Options:  
     
   - 'snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0': Latest Snowflake embedding model  
   - Optimized for English language content  
   - 384-dimensional embeddings

   

3. Warehouse Considerations:  
     
   - Choose size based on data volume  
   - Consider compute costs vs update frequency  
   - Monitor warehouse utilization

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE {{service_name}}
  ON text
  ATTRIBUTES file_name
  WAREHOUSE = {{current_warehouse}}
  TARGET_LAG = '1 day'
  EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0'
  AS (
    SELECT
        text,
        file_name
    FROM docs_text_table
);
```

## Create Streamlit Application

Duration: 20

### Understanding the Chat System Architecture

The chat interface integrates several sophisticated components:

1. Session Management:  
     
   - Maintains conversation state  
   - Handles message history  
   - Manages user context  
   - Enables conversation persistence

2. Context Retrieval System with Snowflake Cortex Search:  
     
   - Performs semantic and keyword search  
   - Ranks relevant chunks  
   - Combines multiple sources  
   - Optimizes context window

3. Prompt Engineering:  
     
   - Constructs dynamic prompts  
   - Incorporates chat history  
   - Maintains conversation coherence  
   - Optimizes Claude's responses

4. Response Generation:  
     
   - Processes Claude's output  
   - Formats responses  
   - Adds source attribution  
   - Handles error cases

### Setting Up the Streamlit App

1. Navigate to Streamlit in Snowflake:  
     
   * Click on the **Streamlit** tab in the left navigation pane  
   * Click on **\+ Streamlit App** button in the top right
   

2. Configure App Settings:  
     
   * Enter a name for your app (e.g., ANTHROPIC\_CHAT\_APP)  
   * Select a warehouse to run the app (Small warehouse is sufficient)  
   * Choose the **ANTHROPIC\_RAG** database and schema


3. Create the app file:  

Because the app front-end is running in Snowflake, all the interactions with the Anthropic model and Cortex Search service are done via the Python interface. If you want to integrate these services with an externally hosted UI, we recommend using the REST APIs for [Cortex LLM inference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-llm-rest-api) and [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#rest-api).
