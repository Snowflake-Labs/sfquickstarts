# S&P Market Intelligence: Analyze Earnings Transcripts with LLMs in Cortex AI
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Earnings calls play a pivotal role in shaping investor perceptions. The quality of communication between executives and analysts can significantly influence company performance. On-topic and proactive executives, who deliver proactive presentations, anticipate market queries, and provide clear, on-topic answers to analysts’ questions—consistently outperform their peers. Conversely, off-topic and reactive executives, who fail to address analysts’ key inquiries during presentations, and provide off-topic responses—significantly underperform.

Executives' ability to anticipate investor concerns and maintain a focused dialogue fosters confidence and strategic communication. In contrast, failing to provide clarity when analysts seek additional information can lead to misalignment and breakdowns in transparency. A long (short) portfolio of on-topic and proactive (off-topic and reactive) generates +515bps of annualized alpha.

This QuickStart with its notebook serves as a introduction for the research detailed in Quantitative Research & Solutions’ recent publication, ["Questioning the Answers: LLM's enter the Boardroom."](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/questioning-the-answers-llms-enter-the-boardroom) It analyses executive on-topicness and proactiveness using the analysts questions, executives answers and LLM answers. This research harnesses alpha using LLM tools, including vector embeddings, vector cosine similarity, and the LLM question answering. There is a longer version available upon request that also covers how to create the input data from the datasets described in section 2, please reach out to <QRS@spglobal.com> for access to the longer version.

Through this QuickStart, you will learn how to use [Snowflake Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks) and [Snowflake Cortex LLM functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions) on earnings call using the [Machine Readable Transcripts](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0Z8P3D2V/s-p-global-market-intelligence-machine-readable-transcripts) dataset from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

### What You’ll Learn

* how to use Snowflake Notebooks
* how to create and use vector embeddings on text data
* how to compare vector embeddings using similarity functions
* how to use generate prompts based on data and use it with Cortex COMPLETE

### What is Snowflake Cortex?

Snowflake Cortex is an intelligent, fully managed service that offers machine learning and AI solutions to Snowflake users. Snowflake Cortex capabilities include:

LLM Functions: SQL and Python functions that leverage large language models (LLMs) for understanding, querying, translating, summarizing, and generating free-form text.

ML Functions: SQL functions that perform predictive analysis such as forecasting and anomaly detection using machine learning to help you gain insights into your structured data and accelerate everyday analytics.

## Setup The Environment
Duration: 10

### Overview
This section covers cloning of the GitHub repository, creating the needed Snowflake objects (i.e role, warehouse, database, schema, etc..) and importing the notebook to be used.

### Clone The Git Repository
The very first step is to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-s-and-p-market-intelligence-analyze-earnings-transcripts-in-cortex-ai). This repository contains all the code you will need to successfully complete this QuickStart Guide.

Using HTTPS:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-s-and-p-market-intelligence-analyze-earnings-transcripts-in-cortex-ai.git
```

OR, using SSH:

```shell
git clone git@https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-s-and-p-market-intelligence-analyze-earnings-transcripts-in-cortex-ai.git
```

You can also use the Git integration feature of Snowflake Notebooks, in order to do that you need to fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-s-and-p-market-intelligence-analyze-earnings-transcripts-in-cortex-ai) to be allowed to commit changes. For instructions how to set up Git integration for your Snowflake account see [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/git/git-setting-up) and for using it with Snowflake Notebooks see [this page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-snowgit). You can refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOa1eUccmQ) for a walkthrough on how you can set up Git integration and use it with Snowflake Notebooks.
