# Streamlining Support Case Analysis with Snowflake Cortex
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

Support case analysis is a critical task for any product-driven company. Understanding customer issues, their frequency, and patterns can significantly enhance product development and customer satisfaction. With the rise of data engineering and AI, platforms like Snowflake with AI-powered language models are game-changers in automating and enhancing this process. In this guide, we will explore how to leverage these technologies to dissect, analyze, and summarize product support cases effectively.

By completing this QuickStart guide, you will deploy a Streamlit application that leverages Snowflake Cortex AI features like LLM Inference and Cortex Search for summarization, search and analysis, alongside the LangChain framework to chain together interoperable components for large language models (LLMs).By leveraging Snowflake Cortex, this solution not only processes but also meaningfully summarizes support tickets, aiding in more agile issue resolution and strategic planning.

### What is Cortex Search
Cortex Search provides low-latency, high-quality fuzzy search capabilities for Snowflake data, enabling a range of advanced search experiences, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

With Cortex Search, one can quickly set up a hybrid (vector and keyword) search engine on the text data in minutes, eliminating the need for embedding management, infrastructure maintenance, search quality adjustments, or index refreshes. This allows you to focus more on building robust chat and search applications and less on managing infrastructure and fine-tuning search quality. 

### Prerequisites

## Setup Environment
Duration: 2

This section will walk you through creating various objects

**Step 1**. - Clone [GitHub](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-analyzing-support-cases-using-snowflake-cortex) repository.


**Step 2**. - Run the code under the scripts/setup.sql file in Snowsight SQL Worksheet.
Once the objects are setup, now let us proceed to the notebook execution 

**Step 3**.
The Notebook is available to download from the /notebook folder in the git repository.

- Overall the Notebook does the following :

1. Fetches summary tickets that is stages in an external stage and loads to a Snowflake table. This can be a direct streaming ingestion or through a connector from a ticketing platform such as ServiceNow.

2. Use a custom class CortexLLM, which uses Snowflake Cortex LLM , to invoke language models that can understand and summarize text. 
   
3. Then we create prompt templates using [langchain PromptTemplate](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html) for mapping and reducing tasks, which instruct the language model on how to process the support case texts.

```
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

map_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
                                            Given the following support cases for an order, return a summary of each case.
                                            Include details on the category of the issue, the errors or symptoms the customer noticed,
                                            and any basic details about what the customer was looking to accomplish.
                                            If multiple cases exist in the same category, you can group them together.
                                            The summary will be used to understand overall case trends and causes that the team can 
                                            use to prioritize fixes and improvements.
                                                
                                            ### Cases ###
                                            
                                            {cases}
                                                """)

reduce_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
                                                Given the following set of summaries for support case reports opened for an order, 
                                                distill it into a final, consolidated and detailed summary of trends and top pain points or blockers customers have been hitting.
                                                Prioritize issue categories that show up in multiple summaries as they are likely to be the most impactful.
                                                Include a description of the issue, the symptoms the customer noticed, what they were trying to do, and what led them to open the case.
                                               
                                                ### Case Chunk Summaries ###
                                               
                                                {summaries} 
                                               """)
```
4. Leveraging the Langchain library, we implement a map-reduce strategy to handle our summarization task. The MapReduceDocumentsChain orchestrates this process, taking our large text input, breaking it down into manageable chunks, processing each chunk to create individual summaries, and finally reducing these summaries into a comprehensive overview of customer issues.

5. We configure an InMemoryCache and set up Tiktoken caching. Tiktoken is a tokenization library that efficiently converts text into tokens, a format required by most AI models for natural language processing tasks.

6. Once the map-reduce chain is invoked, the results are returned in a structured format, including both the intermediate steps and the final summarized output. We then structure this data into a schema and save it as a new table in Snowflake for easy access and analysis.

7. Finally we create a Cortex Search Service within Snowflake. This service allows us to do a lexical and keyword - hybrid search through our support cases using natural language queries, making it easier to find specific issues or patterns in the data.
