# How To Accelerate Data Warehouse Migrations With SnowConvert AI

## 1. Overview

Duration: 5

At its core, data migration is the process of moving data between locations like on-premises servers, cloud platforms, or SaaS applications. This is typically driven by key business events like modernizing legacy infrastructure, centralizing data for analytics, or preparing datasets for AI training. However, an unsuccessful migration can lead to data loss, business disruptions and compliance issues.

SnowConvert AI and Snowpark Migration Accelerator are both tools from Snowflake designed to assist in code migration, but they serve different purposes. 

![](assets/image_01.png)

SnowConvert AI is an AI-powered solution for migrating entire data ecosystems, including code and objects, from a wide range of legacy data warehouses and BI tools (such as Teradata, Oracle, and Google BigQuery) to Snowflake. Its core function is to intelligently automate the conversion of SQL-based workloads, reducing manual effort. This guide provides a complete, end-to-end walkthrough of a SnowConvert AI migration project, from initial setup and extraction to code conversion, deployment, and final data validation.

![](assets/image_02.png)

In contrast, the [Snowpark Migration Accelerator](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/migration-accelerator/) is a specialized, free tool for migrations from Databricks or another Spark platform. Briefly, it converts existing Apache Spark codebases (in Python or Scala) to leverage the Snowpark API.

## 3. Understanding SnowConvert AI Projects

Duration: 5

The process begins when a user creates a new project and assigns it a name. The user then selects the source code to be migrated; in the provided example, the source is SQL Server. To utilize SnowConvert, a free access code is required, which can be requested and is sent immediately via email. A local working folder must also be set up on the user's machine for the project. In addition to code conversion, the tool offers optional features to replatform ETLs, like Informatica or SSIS, and to repoint Power BI reports to the new Snowflake database.

### What is a SnowConvert Project?

A SnowConvert AI Project (`.snowct` file) is a local file that stores:

* Source platform configuration  
* Conversion settings  
* Project status and progress  
* Assessment and conversion results

Each time you "Save & Start Assessment", SnowConvert AI creates a `.snowct` project file. The file is saved in the same folder as your input source code and it contains all project configurations and status.

Here are some of the benefits of SnowConvert AI project files:

* Resume work from where you left off  
* Maintain consistent conversion settings  
* Track progress across migration phases  
* Share project configurations with team members

### Project Setup

To initiate the migration process:

1. Launch SnowConvert AI  
2. Click "Create New Project"  
3. Select source platform (Teradata, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)  
4. Choose input folder containing source code  
5. Select output folder for converted code  
6. Enter access code

When resuming the migration process:

* Double-click on the `.snowct` file. This will open SnowConvert AI.   
* Use "Open Project" button in the application  
* Access recent projects via File → Open Recents

## 4. Database Object Extraction

Duration: 15

### Extraction Overview

After the project setup, the extraction phase begins. For a source like SQL Server, SnowConvert AI can connect directly to the database catalog to extract the Data Definition Language (DDL). As an alternative, code can be accessed from a local drive or a Git repository. During the extraction, SnowConvert AI connects to the source database and pulls the definitions for objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures. Once complete, it provides a summary of all the objects that were successfully extracted, such as the number of databases, schemas, and tables.

SnowConvert AI provides direct database connectivity to extract objects from source systems, currently supporting SQL Server and Amazon Redshift.

For other sources, you will still need to extract your SQL code into .sql files. You can use database export scripts here: [https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/SC.DDLExportScripts](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/SC.DDLExportScripts) 

### SQL Server Extraction

SnowConvert AI offers flexible authentication options to seamlessly integrate with your existing SQL Server environments. The platform supports two primary methods, ensuring secure and efficient access to your databases:

* **Standard SQL Server Authentication:** Uses a username and password.  
![](assets/image_07.png)  
* **Windows Authentication (Integrated Security):** Leverages the Windows user's security credentials, often preferred in enterprise environments for seamless, secure integration with existing Windows security policies.  
![](assets/image_08.png)

**Security Options:**

* Trust Server Certificate (required if database uses trusted certificates)  
* Encrypt Connection (required for encrypted connections)

**Extractable Objects:**

* Tables (structure and metadata)  
* Views (definitions and dependencies)  
* Functions (scalar and table-valued)  
* Stored procedures (complete logic)

### Amazon Redshift Extraction

**Authentication Methods:**

* IAM Provisioned Cluster  
![](assets/image_09.png)  
* IAM Serverless  
![](assets/image_10.png)  
* Standard authentication  
![](assets/image_11.png)

**Extractable Objects:**

* Tables  
* Views  
* Materialized views  
* Stored procedures

### Extraction Process![](assets/image_12.png)

-- Original SQL Server procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerOrders
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
    FROM Orders
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID
END

-- Will be prepared for conversion to Snowflake format
```

## 5. Code Conversion and Assessment

Duration: 5

### Conversion Process Overview

SnowConvert AI performs both assessment and conversion in a single unified process, generating comprehensive reports and converted code simultaneously.

**Step 1: Conversion Settings**

* **Encoding:** Select appropriate character encoding (UTF-8 default)  
* **Custom Schema:** Specify target schema name if different from source  
* **Database Name:** Set custom database name for converted objects  
* **Target Language:** Choose SnowScript or JavaScript for procedures  
* **Comments:** Enable commenting of nodes with missing dependencies

**Step 2: Execute Conversion**

1. Click "Save & Start Assessment"  
2. Monitor conversion progress  
3. Review completion status  
4. Examine generated reports  
   

### Understanding Conversion Results

**Code Completeness Metric:**  
![](assets/image_16.png)

* Score below 100% indicates missing object references  
* Review dependencies before deployment  
* Address missing references in source code

**Conversion Status Indicators:**

* **Green:** Successfully converted, ready for deployment  
* **Yellow:** Functional Data Model (FDM) warnings present  
* **Red:** Equivalent Work Item (EWI) errors require attention

**Assessment Reports:**

* Conversion summary statistics  
* Object-by-object conversion status  
* Complexity analysis and recommendations  
* Migration effort estimates

```sql
-- Example conversion result
-- Original Teradata SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_amount) as total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= ADD_MONTHS(CURRENT_DATE, -12)
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Converted Snowflake SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_amount) as total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(MONTH, -12, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## 6. AI Verification

Duration: 10

### Overview

The AI Verification step (currently in Public Preview) adds a layer of intelligence to migrations by using AI agents to automatically verify and resolve errors that occur after the deterministic conversion step (the Code Conversion step is executed by a transpiler). The AI fixes are grounded with tests over synthetically generated data. This improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and makes migrations faster, more reliable, and more scalable. AI will attempt to execute the converted code and fix issues if it is not working.

### Step-by-Step flow

After the code conversion step customers can opt to use AI Verification to improve the quality of the converted code. If a customer is not allowed to use AI, this step can be skipped and continue to the Deployment of the converted objects ( as you can see in the image below, SKIP AI VERIFICATION button shows in the lower left corner of the screen). To continue with AI Verification we need to select which objects we want to verify.  Sometimes certain objects will be auto selected by SnowConvert AI because they are dependencies of the selected objects. So don't be scared if you select one procedure but the tool auto selects a few tables, views and even other procedures. This means all those objects are required to be able to execute the selected stored procedure.  

![](assets/image_17.png)

Once objects are selected, the VERIFY CODE can be clicked, which will display a special screen with a set of disclaimers. It is important to read and understand these disclaimers before proceeding. The AI will be executed in the customer Snowflake account using a Cortex Complete function. The tool will use the same Snowflake connection that was used for Source Code Extraction and that will be used for Deployment and Data Migration.

![](assets/image_18.png)

Once the user accepts all of the disclaimers, they can proceed with the actual verification. This step may take a long time as AI needs to upload files to a Snowflake stage to complete the verification process. At the end of the process, you will get a result screen similar to the image below.  
![](assets/image_19.png)

At the top of your screen, you'll find a summary of the AI Results, followed by detailed information for each validated object. To gain a deeper understanding of how the AI reviewed a specific object, click "SEE DETAILS" for that object. This will display an explanation similar to the example shown in the following image.

![](assets/image_20.png)

It is important to understand that the migration engineer needs to review the AI results and merge them with the initial code conversion results.

## 7. SSIS Replatform

Duration: 10

### Overview

SSIS Replatform is a specialized SnowConvert AI capability designed to convert SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) `.dtsx` packages to Snowflake-native solutions. This feature transforms complex ETL workflows into modern data pipelines using Snowflake tasks, procedures, and dbt projects.

For optimal conversion results, ensure that your input includes valid `.dtsx` files and all dependent database objects (DDL scripts for tables, views, functions, and procedures referenced by the SSIS packages).

The replatform process separates SSIS packages into two components:

1. **Control Flow Orchestration:** Converted to SQL scripts with Snowflake tasks and stored procedures.  
2. **Data Flow Tasks:** Transformed into individual dbt projects for each data flow component.

### Project Setup for SSIS Replatform

1. Launch SnowConvert AI  
2. Click "Create New Project"  
3. **Important:** Select "SQL Server" as the source platform  
4. In the extraction configuration section, select "Replatform" option  
5. Enter the path to your SSIS `.dtsx` files

### DTSX Conversion Process

1. Proceed with the conversion process.  
2. SnowConvert AI analyzes all `.dtsx` files and dependencies  
3. Conversion proceeds following the standard SnowConvert AI workflow  
4. Control flow tasks converted to Snowflake stored procedures and tasks  
5. Data flow tasks converted to individual dbt projects

The converted ETL code will be available in the SnowConvert AI output folder under the `ETL` directory. An `etl_configuration` folder will also be created containing utilities and configuration files. Additionally, `ETL.Elements.NA.csv` and `ETL.Issues.NA.csv` files provide detailed information about the ETL conversion process and any issues encountered.

### Output Structure

```
output/
└── ETL/
    └── [same folder structure as input]/
        └── [Package_Name]/
            ├── Orchestration.sql
            ├── Data Flow Task 1/
            │   ├── dbt_project.yml
            │   ├── models/
            │   └── sources/
            └── [Additional Data Flow Tasks]/
```

### Understanding Conversion Results

Review the generated CSV files for detailed conversion information:

* **ETL.Elements.NA.csv:** Details about converted ETL elements  
* **ETL.Issues.NA.csv:** Issues encountered during conversion

### Deployment Process

1. Deploy Snowflake tasks and stored procedures  
2. Deploy the dbt projects in your environment  
3. Manually fix the failing components and validate model compilation and execution

## 8. Power BI Repointing

Duration: 10

### Overview

Power BI repointing is a SnowConvert AI feature that allows users to redefine connections from different database sources to a Snowflake valid connector. Currently, the supported sources are:

1. [SQL Server](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/transact/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-transact-repointing)  
2. [Oracle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/oracle/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-oracle-repointing)  
3. [Teradata](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/teradata/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-teradata-repointing)  
4. [Redshift](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/redshift/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-redshift-repointing)  
5. [Azure Synapse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/transact/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-transact-repointing)  
6. [PostgreSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/migrations/snowconvert-docs/translation-references/postgres/etl-bi-repointing/power-bi-postgres-repointing)

It is recommended that DDLs should be migrated with the Power BI repointing migration process, which would allow SnowConvert AI to identify objects such as tables and views.

### Power BI Repointing Set Up

1. Save your Power BI projects with .pbit extension.  
2. Open SnowConvert AI.  
3. Optionally, add your DDLs.  
4. Select the source language that you are using in your Power BI reports, i.e. SQL Server.  
5. Add your .pbit files on the Power BI repointing section.  
6. Click on the “continue to conversion” button.

### Power BI Repointing Results

1. Open your repointed Power BI report.  
2. Fill the Power BI parameters with your Snowflake account information: server link, warehouse name, and database name. (This is automatically added by SnowConvert AI).  
3. Refresh your data in your reports.   
4. Double-check results.  
5. Save your repointed report with the format you need. i.e. .pbix. 

### Assessment

To review the overall status of the repointed reports, you can review the “ETLAndBiRepointing” assessment report. This report contains the report name and a summary of the changed connectors.

## 9. Deployment to Snowflake

Duration: 15

### Deployment Overview

SnowConvert AI facilitates the direct deployment of converted code objects and schemas to your Snowflake environment. This process includes comprehensive dependency management and precise execution ordering, ensuring a smooth and accurate transition.

### Authentication Methods

**SSO Authentication:**

* Integrates with the organization's Single Sign-On (SSO) provider for a seamless authentication experience.  
* Supports enterprise identity management systems.

**Standard Authentication:**

* Username and password authentication  
* Requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled  
* Account identifier format: `orgname-account-name`

### Pre-Deployment Validation

**Step 1: Review Conversion Status**

* Examine status indicators for each object (e.g., successful, needs review).  
* Review Converted Code: Examine the generated Snowflake SQL for key objects (e.g., procedures, functions) to confirm the logic is correctly translated before deployment.  
* Resolve any EWI (Error with Impact) errors before deployment.  
* Review FDM (Further Development Mandatory) warnings and decide if deployment is acceptable.  
* Use "Refresh Tree" to update status after code changes  

> aside positive
> MANDATORY:
> Resolve any EWI (Error with Impact) errors before deployment. These errors represent logic that could not be reliably converted and will cause deployment failure or runtime errors if not corrected.
> 
> **Handling EWI Errors:**   
> SnowConvert AI is designed to flag these high-impact errors, but cannot always fix them. To resolve an EWI, you must:  
> 1. **Examine the code snippet** in the SnowConvert AI interface that triggered the EWI or better yet in your preferred Source Code IDE. [Learn more](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/end2endmigration/index.html?index=..%2F..index#3)  
> 2. **Manually modify the converted source code** to fix the issue..  
> 3. **Unit test** on the corrected file.  
>
> **Object Selection:**  
> * Select only successfully converted objects  
> * Consider deployment dependencies  
> * Group related objects for batch deployment

**Step 2: Initiate Deployment**

1. Select objects for deployment  
2. Click "Deploy" button  
3. Choose authentication method  
4. Provide Snowflake credentials

**Step 3: Authentication**

```sql
-- Example Snowflake connection details
Account: myorg-myaccount
Username: migration_user
Warehouse: MIGRATION_WH
Database: TARGET_DB
Schema: PUBLIC
Role: MIGRATION_ROLE
```

**Step 4: Execution Order** Deployment follows this automatic sequence:

1. Databases (create container structure)  
2. Schemas (organize object namespaces)  
3. Tables (establish data structures)  
4. Views (depend on table structures)  
5. Functions (provide reusable logic)  
6. Stored Procedures (may reference other objects)

**Step 5: Monitor Progress**

* Track deployment status for each object  
* Review execution logs and results  
* Address any deployment errors immediately

### Deployment Results

**Success Indicators:**

* Object created successfully in Snowflake  
* Proper dependency resolution  
* Correct object permissions applied

**Error Handling:**

* Review detailed error messages  
* Fix source code issues if needed  
* Re-run conversion if necessary  
* Retry deployment for failed objects

```sql
-- Example deployed object in Snowflake
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_customer_orders(customer_id INTEGER)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SNOWSCRIPT
AS
$$
BEGIN
    LET result_cursor CURSOR FOR 
        SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount
        FROM orders
        WHERE customer_id = :customer_id;
    
    RETURN 'Procedure executed successfully';
END;
$$;
```

## 10. Data Migration

Duration: 25

### Data Migration Overview

SnowConvert AI provides automated data migration capabilities to transfer actual data from Teradata, Oracle, SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, Synapse, Sybase, BigQuery, Netezza, Postgres, Greenplum and Databricks SQL source tables to deployed Snowflake structures, with platform-specific optimization strategies.

For migrations from Databricks or another Spark platform, you’ll use [Snowpark Migration Accelerator](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/migration-accelerator/).

### Amazon Redshift Data Migration

**Migration Strategy:** Redshift data is migrated using S3 as an intermediary storage layer:

1. Data unloaded from Redshift to PARQUET files in S3  
2. Files copied directly from S3 to Snowflake tables  
3. Temporary files cleaned up automatically

**Prerequisites:**

1. **S3 Bucket Configuration:**  
![](assets/image_21.png)
     
* Bucket in same region as Redshift cluster  
* Empty bucket path (no existing files)  
* Proper IAM permissions configured  
    
2. **IAM Role for Redshift:**

This JSON snippet defines an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role specifically for Amazon Redshift, which is crucial for data migration, particularly when Redshift data is migrated using S3 as an intermediary storage layer.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **IAM User for S3 Access:**

This JSON snippet defines an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policy for S3 Access. This policy outlines the permissions granted to an IAM user to interact with a specific Amazon S3 bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Migration Process:**

The migration process outlines the essential steps for efficiently transferring data from Redshift to Snowflake, ensuring data integrity and performance.

-- Grant minimal required permissions
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE migration_wh TO ROLE migration_role;
GRANT CREATE TABLE ON SCHEMA target_db.public TO ROLE migration_role;
GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA target_db.public TO ROLE migration_role;
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Migration Monitoring:**

- Track conversion success rates by object type  
- Monitor data migration progress and timing  
- Set up alerts for migration failures

Adhering to best practices is crucial for a successful and efficient migration to Snowflake. This section outlines key considerations across SSIS replatforming, general migration strategies, data validation, and code conversion, providing guidance to optimize performance, ensure data integrity, and streamline the overall process.

### SSIS Replatform

* Document SSIS package dependencies and custom components.  
* Review `ETL.Elements.NA.csv` and `ETL.Issues.NA.csv` for conversion details.

### Migration

**Performance Optimization:**

- Migrate large tables during off-peak hours  
- Use parallel migration for multiple small tables  
- Monitor network bandwidth utilization  
- Consider table partitioning for very large datasets

**Error Handling:**

- Log detailed error information for troubleshooting  
- Maintain rollback capabilities where possible  
- Validate partial migrations before continuing

**Data Integrity Checks:**

```sql
-- Example validation query
-- Compare row counts between source and target
SELECT 
    'Source Count' as source,
    COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM source_database.schema.table_name
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Target Count' as source,
    COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM target_database.schema.table_name;
```
