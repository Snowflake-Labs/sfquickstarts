# An Introduction to Tasty Bytes
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## An Introduction to Tasty Bytes 
Duration: 1
<img src="assets/tasty_bytes_header.png"/>

### Overview
Within this Tasty Bytes Introduction Quickstart you will first be learning about the fictious food truck brand, Tasty Bytes, created by the frostbyte team at Snowflake.

After learning about the Tasty Bytes Organization, we will complete the process of setting up the Tasty Bytes Foundational Data Model, Workload Specific Roles + Warehouses and all necessary Role Based Access Control (RBAC). 

Upon finishing this Quickstart, you will have deployed the foundation required to run the Quickstarts seen in our [Powered by Tasty Bytes - Quickstarts](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/tasty_bytes_introduction/index.html#3) section.

### Who is Tasty Bytes?

## Setting up Tasty Bytes
Duration: 6

### Overview
For this Quickstart, you will use the Snowflake web interface known as Snowsight. If this is your first time leveraging Snowsight we would highly consider taking a look at our [Snowsight Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight) for a high-level walkthrough.

### Step 1 - Accessing Snowflake via URL
- Open a browser window and enter the URL of your Snowflake Account. If you do not already have a Snowflake account please revisit the previous section to sign up for a Free Snowflake Trial Account. 

### Step 2 - Logging into Snowflake
- Log into your Snowflake account.
    - <img src ="assets/log_into_snowflake.gif" width = "300"/>

### Step 3 - Navigating to Worksheets
- Click on the Worksheets Tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
    - <img src ="assets/worksheet_tab.png" width="250"/>

### Step 4 - Creating a Worksheet
- Within Worksheets, click the "+" button in the top-right corner of Snowsight and choose "SQL Worksheet"
    - <img src = "assets/+_sqlworksheet.png" width ="200">

### Step 5 - Renaming a Worksheet
- Rename the Worksheet by clicking on the auto-generated Timestamp name and inputting "Tasty Bytes - Setup"
    - <img src ="assets/rename_worksheet_tasty_bytes_setup.gif"/>

### Step 6 - Accessing hosted Setup SQL in GitHub
- Click the button below which will direct you to our Tasty Bytes SQL Setup file that is hosted on GitHub.

<button>[tb_introduction.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sf-samples/blob/main/samples/tasty_bytes/tb_introduction.sql)</button>

### Step 7 - Copying Setup SQL from GitHub
- Within GitHub navigate to the right side and click "Copy raw contents". This will copy all of the required SQL into your clipboard.
    - <img src ="assets/github_copy_raw_contents.png"/>

### Step 8 - Pasting Setup SQL from GitHub into your Snowflake Worksheet
- Path back to Snowsight and your newly created Worksheet and Paste (*CMD + V for Mac or CTRL + V for Windows*) what we just copied from GitHub.

### Step 9 - Synchronously Running all Setup SQL
- Click inside the newly created Tasty Bytes - Setup Worksheet, Select All (*CMD + A for Mac or CTRL + A for Windows*) and Click "► Run" 
    - <img src ="assets/run_all_queries.gif"/>

### Step 10 - Completing Setup
- After clicking "► Run" you will see queries begin to execute. These queries will run one after another with the entire worksheet taking around 5 minutes. Upon completion you will see a message stating `frostbyte_tasty_bytes setup is now complete` .

## Exploring the Tasty Bytes Foundation
Duration: 2

### Overview
With the Tasty Bytes Setup successful, we can now explore the Database, Roles and Warehouses we created. 

>aside negative
>**Note:** Within the *Tasty Bytes - Setup* worksheet you created in previous section, please scroll to the bottom and Copy, Paste and  Run the SQL included in each step below.
>

### Step 1 - Exploring the Tasty Bytes Database
This query will return the Database we created via [SHOW DATABASES](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-databases.html).
```
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'frostbyte_tasty_bytes';
```
<img src = "assets/show_tb_db.png"> 

### Step 2 - Exploring the Schemas within the Tasty Bytes Database
This query will return the Schemas within the Database we created via [SHOW SCHEMAS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-schemas).
```
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE frostbyte_tasty_bytes;
```
<img src = "assets/show_tb_schemas.png"> 

### Step 3 - Exploring the Tables within the RAW_POS Schema within the Tasty Bytes Database
This query will return the Tables within the `raw_pos` schema via [SHOW TABLES](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-tables)
```
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos;
```
<img src = "assets/show_tb_tables.png"> 

### Step 4 - Exploring the Tasty Bytes Roles
This query will return the Roles we created via [SHOW ROLES](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-roles).
```
SHOW ROLES LIKE 'tasty%';
```
<img src = "assets/show_tb_roles.png"> 

### Step 5 - Exploring the Tasty Bytes Warehouses
This query will return the Warehouses we created via [SHOW WAREHOUSES](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses).
```
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'tasty%';
```
<img src = "assets/show_tb_whs.png"> 

### Step 6 - Putting it All Together
These next three queries will:
1. Assume the `tasty_data_engineer` role via [USE ROLE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-role.html)
2. Leverage the `tasty_de_wh` Warehouse via [USE WAREHOUSE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-warehouse.html)
3. Query our `raw_pos.menu` table to find which Menu Items are sold at our Plant Palace branded food trucks.
    
```
USE ROLE tasty_data_engineer;
USE WAREHOUSE tasty_de_wh;

SELECT
    m.menu_type_id,
    m.menu_type,
    m.truck_brand_name,
    m.menu_item_name
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.menu m
WHERE m.truck_brand_name = 'Plant Palace';
```
<img src = "assets/plant_palace.png"> 

Amazing! Within a few minutes we now have a Tasty Bytes demo environment complete with data, roles and warehouses set up in our Snowflake account. Let's now take a look at all of the other Tasty Bytes Quickstarts available to us to leverage.
