# AI21's Jamba-Instruct Quickstart | SEC 10K Decoder Without RAG
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

In this quickstart, we will review how to build a Streamlit App within Snowflake that allows you to easily analyze years of NVIDIA 10K filings using Jamba-Instruct in Cortex. With Jamba’s 256K context window, there is no requirement to build a RAG pipeline that chunks the filings into segments that fit into a smaller context window.

### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit enables Snowflake users to combine Streamlit’s component-rich, open-source Python library with the scale, performance, and security of the Snowflake platform.

### What is Snowflake Cortex?
Snowflake Cortex AI provides access to top-tier LLMs within your Snowflake environment. Build GenAI applications with fully managed LLMs and chat with your data services.
https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/cortex/

### What is Jamba-Instruct?
AI21’s Jamba-Instruct is the world’s first-ever commercial LLM to successfully leverage SSM-Transformer architecture. This hybrid approach delivers leading quality, performance, and cost, offering the best value per cost across an impressive 256k context window.

### Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account in a region where Snowflake Cortex and Jamba-Instruct are available. [check availability](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions?_fsi=mg3vAFop&_fsi=mg3vAFop#label-cortex-llm-availability)
- A Snowflake account that is [credentialed to mount data](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers) from the Marketplace 


### What You’ll Learn 
- How to access data from the Snowflake Marketplace
- How to call Jamba-Instruct from within Snowflake Cortex
- Best practices for prompting Jamba-Instruct

### What You’ll Build 
This Streamlit application within Snowflake illustrates Jamba-Instruct's text analysis capabilities using Cybersyn's SEC Filings database. While 10K filings serve as our example, Jamba-Instruct on Cortex can be applied to various text-intensive scenarios such as processing internal documentation, analyzing customer feedback, or tackling any large-scale text analysis task specific to your industry.

## Setup code and streamlit prerequisites
Duration: 5

### Step 1: Accessing the data in Snowflake Marketplace
<button>

  [Get Cybersyn's SEC Filings Data](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KH9/cybersyn-sec-filings)
</button>


After logging into your Snowflake account, access [Cybersyn’s SEC Filings](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KH9/cybersyn-sec-filings) in the Marketplace.
- Click the Get button on the top right box of the listing
- Read and accept the terms
- Note: This data listing is available for free, at no additional charge
- The data is now available in your Snowflake Instance, as the SEC_FILINGS database under the Data menu on the left hand side panel

![Accessing_the_data_in_Snowflake_Marketplace](assets/Accessing_the_data_in_Snowflake_Marketplace.png)

### Step 2: Create a database and schema where the Streamlit app will run

- On the left side panel, click Data
- Click the blue + Database button in the top right corner
- Create a new database with a name of your choosing (e.g. CORTEX_STREAMLIT) for the Streamlit app to live in
- Create a new Schema in the database you created (e.g. CORTEX_STREAMLIT) with a name of your choosing (e.g. JAMBA)

### Step 3: Create the Streamlit app in Snowflake

- On the left side panel, click Streamlit
- Click the blue + Streamlit App button in the top right corner
  - Make sure the role that you are using has access to Snowflake Cortex AI [Required Privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions?_fsi=mg3vAFop&_fsi=mg3vAFop#required-privileges)
  - Name your App (e.g. Jamba-10K-Decoder)
  - Select a Warehouse (XS will work for this demonstration)
  - Select the database and schema for your app. If you followed Step 2, select this database (e.g. CORTEX_STREAMLIT and JAMBA)
  - Click the blue Create button
  - Delete all of the existing code

### Step 4: Copy the Streamlit app code from GitHub

[Streamlit GitHub Code](https://github.com/AI21Labs/AI21-Industry-Samples/blob/main/Snowflake_10K_Decoder/Snowflake_10K_Decoder.py)

- Click the button above which will direct you to our Jamba-Instruct quickstart code that is hosted on GitHub.
- Within GitHub, navigate to the right side of the window and click the ‘Copy Raw Contents’ button. This will copy all of the required Python code into your clipboard.
- Paste the Python code into the Streamlit code area in your newly created Streamlit app in Snowflake.

### Step 5: Run the Jamba Streamlit Application

- In the upper right corner of your Snowflake Streamlit app, click the blue Run button.
- Wait for the app to load.

**You’ve successfully built the Jamba-Instruct 10K Decoder Streamlit app in Snowflake!**

## Using Jamba-Instruct in Cortex
Duration: 3

AI21’s Jamba-Instruct is a powerful language model designed with a 256k context window to handle large volumes of text, up to ~800 pages, making it ideal for tasks such as summarizing lengthy documents, analyzing call transcripts, and extracting information from extensive data.

Another major advantage of a long context window is its capacity to make advanced techniques more accessible, often eliminating the need for complex configurations. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is frequently employed to anchor language models with a company’s curated data, Jamba-Instruct’s long context window allows for achieving accurate results with or without RAG, simplifying the architecture and enhancing performance across various applications.

### 10K-Decoder Usage


Cybersyn’s [SEC_FILINGS](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KH9/cybersyn-sec-filings?originTab=provider&providerName=Cybersyn%2C&ref=blog.streamlit.io) database is used for this application. This dataset provides real-world SEC filing documents for many companies, illustrating Jamba-Instruct's effectiveness in processing large volumes of text in a single prompt. The last few years of NVIDIA 10K filings are used for this demonstration. There are over 200k tokens in this text, and using Jamba-Instruct, you can fit all this text (and your questions about it) into a single prompt!

### Prompting Tips

- Be clear with your prompt
- Ensure your prompt doesn’t contain grammatical errors
- Describe what you want, not what you don’t want
