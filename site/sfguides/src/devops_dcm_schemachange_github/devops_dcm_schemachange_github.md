# DevOps: Database Change Management with schemachange and GitHub
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

<img src="assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-1.png" width="600" />

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions for how to build a simple CI/CD pipeline for Snowflake with GitHub Actions. My hope is that this will provide you with enough details to get you started on your DevOps journey with Snowflake and GitHub Actions.

DevOps is concerned with automating the development, release and maintenance of software applications. As such, DevOps is very broad and covers the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The landscape of software tools used to manage the entire SDLC is complex since there are many different required capabilities/tools, including:

- Requirements management
- Project management (Waterfall, Agile/Scrum)
- Source code management (Version Control)
- Build management (CI/CD)
- Test management (CI/CD)
- Release management (CI/CD)

This guide will focus primarily on automated release management for Snowflake by leveraging the GitHub Actions service from GitHub. Additionally, in order to manage the database objects/changes in Snowflake I will use the schemachange Database Change Management (DCM) tool.

Let’s begin with a brief overview of GitHub and schemachange.

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have a basic working knowledge of Git repositories.

### What You'll Learn

* A brief history and overview of GitHub Actions
* A brief history and overview of schemachange
* How database change management tools like schemachange work
* How a simple release pipeline works
* How to create CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions
* Ideas for more advanced CI/CD pipelines with stages
* How to get started with branching strategies
* How to get started with testing strategies

### What You'll Need

You will need the following things before beginning:

1. Snowflake
  1. **A Snowflake Account.**
  1. **A Snowflake Database named DEMO_DB.**
  1. **A Snowflake User created with appropriate permissions.** This user will need permission to create objects in the DEMO_DB database.
1. GitHub
  1. **A GitHub Account.** If you don’t already have a GitHub account you can create one for free. Visit the [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join) page to get started.
  1. **A GitHub Repository.** If you don't already have a repository created, or would like to create a new one, then [Create a new respository](https://github.com/new). For the type, select `Public` (although you could use either). And you can skip adding the README, .gitignore and license for now.
1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  1. **Your favorite IDE with Git integration.** If you don’t already have a favorite IDE that integrates with Git I would recommend the great, free, open-source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  1. **Your project repository cloned to your computer.** For connection details about your Git repository, open the Repository and copy the `HTTPS` link provided near the top of the page. If you have at least one file in your repository then click on the green `Code` icon near the top of the page and copy the `HTTPS` link. Use that link in VS Code or your favorite IDE to clone the repo to your computer.

### What You'll Build

* A simple, working release pipeline for Snowflake in GitHub Actions

### GitHub
GitHub provides a complete, end-to-end set of software development tools to manage the SDLC. In particular GitHub provides the following services (from GitHub's [Features](https://github.com/features)):

- Collaborative Coding
- Automation & CI/CD
- Security
- Client Apps
- Project Management
- Team Administration
- Community

<img src="assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-3.png" width="250" />

### GitHub Actions
"GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want" (from GitHub’s [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)). GitHub Actions was [first announced in October 2018](https://github.blog/2018-10-16-future-of-software/) and has since become a popular CI/CD tool. To learn more about GitHub Actions, including migrating from other popular CI/CD tools to GitHub Actions check out [Learn GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions).

This guide will be focused on the GitHub Actions service.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## schemachange Overview
Duration: 2

<img src="assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-4.png" width="250" />

Database Change Management (DCM) refers to a set of processes and tools which are used to manage the objects within a database. It’s beyond the scope of this guide to provide details around the challenges with and approaches to automating the management of your database objects. If you’re interested in more details, please see my blog post [Embracing Agile Software Delivery and DevOps with Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/embracing-agile-software-delivery-and-devops-with-snowflake/).

schemachange is a lightweight Python-based tool to manage all your Snowflake objects. It follows an imperative-style approach to database change management (DCM) and was inspired by [the Flyway database migration tool](https://flywaydb.org/). When schemachange is combined with a version control tool and a CI/CD tool, database changes can be approved and deployed through a pipeline using modern software delivery practices.

For more information about schemachange please see [the schemachange project page](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/schemachange).

Negative
: **Note** - schemachange is a community-developed tool, not an official Snowflake offering. It comes with no support or warranty.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create Your First Database Migration
Duration: 4

Open up your cloned repository in your favorite IDE and create a folder named `migrations`. In that new folder create a script named `V1.1.1__initial_objects.sql` (make sure there are two underscores after the version number) with the following contents:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA DEMO;
CREATE TABLE HELLO_WORLD
(
   FIRST_NAME VARCHAR
  ,LAST_NAME VARCHAR
);
```

Then commit the new script and push the changes to your GitHub repository. Assuming you started from an empty repository, your repository should look like this:

![GitHub repository after first change script](assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-5.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create Action Secrets
Duration: 5

Action Secrets in GitHub are used to securely store values/variables which will be used in your CI/CD pipelines. In this step we will create secrets for each of the parameters used by schemachange.

From the repository, click on the `Settings` tab near the top of the page. From the Settings page, click on the `Secrets` tab in the left hand navigation. The `Actions` secrets should be selected. For each secret listed below click on `New repository secret` near the top right and enter the name given below along with the appropriate value (adjusting as appropriate).

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Secret name</th>
            <th>Secret value</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_ACCOUNT</td>
            <td>xy12345.east-us-2.azure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_USERNAME</td>
            <td>DEMO_USER</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_PASSWORD</td>
            <td>*****</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_ROLE</td>
            <td>DEMO_ROLE</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_WAREHOUSE</td>
            <td>DEMO_WH</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SF_DATABASE</td>
            <td>DEMO_DB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Positive
: **Tip** - For more details on how to structure the account name in SF_ACCOUNT, see the account name discussion in [the Snowflake Python Connector install guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-install.html#step-2-verify-your-installation).

When you’re finished adding all the secrets, the page should look like this:

![GitHub Actions Secrets after setup](assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-6.png)

Positive
: **Tip** - For an even better solution to managing your secrets, you can leverage [GitHub Actions Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments). Environments allow you to group secrets together and define protection rules for each of your environments.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create an Actions Workflow
Duration: 5

Action Workflows represent automated pipelines, which inludes both build and release pipelines. They are defined as YAML files and stored in your repository in a directory called `.github/workflows`. In this step we will create a deployment workflow which will run schemachange and deploy changes to our Snowflake database.

Positive
: **Tip** - For more details about Action Workflows and runs check out the [Introduction to GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions) page.

- From the repository, click on the `Actions` tab near the top middle of the page.
- Click on the `set up a workflow yourself ->` link (if you already have a workflow defined click on the `new workflow` button and then the `set up a workflow yourself ->` link)
- On the new workflow page
  - Name the workflow `snowflake-devops-demo.yml`
  - In the `Edit new file` box, replace the contents with the the following:

```yaml  
name: snowflake-devops-demo

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'migrations/**'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy-snowflake-changes-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Python 3.8.x
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2.2.1
        with:
          python-version: 3.8.x

      - name: Run schemachange
        env:
          SF_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SF_ACCOUNT }}
          SF_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SF_USERNAME }}
          SF_ROLE: ${{ secrets.SF_ROLE }}
          SF_WAREHOUSE: ${{ secrets.SF_WAREHOUSE }}
          SF_DATABASE: ${{ secrets.SF_DATABASE }}
          SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SF_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          echo "GITHUB_WORKSPACE: $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"
          python --version
          echo "Step 1: Installing schemachange"
          pip install schemachange
          
          echo "Step 2: Running schemachange"
          schemachange -f $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/migrations -a $SF_ACCOUNT -u $SF_USERNAME -r $SF_ROLE -w $SF_WAREHOUSE -d $SF_DATABASE -c $SF_DATABASE.SCHEMACHANGE.CHANGE_HISTORY --create-change-history-table
```

Finally, click on the green `Start commit` button near the top right of the page and then click on the green `Commit new file` in the pop up window (you can leave the default comments and commit settings). You'll now be taken to the workflow folder in your repository.

A few things to point out from the YAML pipeline definition:

- The `on:` definition configures the pipeline to automatically run when a change is committed anywhere in the `migrations` folder on the `main` branch of the repository. So any change committed outside of that folder or in a different branch will not automatically trigger the workflow to run.
- Please note that if you are re-using an existing GitHub repository it might retain the old `master` branch naming. If so, please update the YAML above (see the `on:` section).
- We’re using the default GitHub-hosted Linux agent to execute the pipeline.
- The `env` section of the `Run schemachange` step allows us to set environment variables which will be available to the Bash script. In particular, this allows us to securely pass secret values (like the Snowflake password) to applications/scripts running in the workflow like schemachange.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Manually Run the Actions Workflow
Duration: 4

In this step we will manually run the new Actions workflow for the first time. This will deploy the first database migration script we created in step 4.

- From the repository, click on the `Actions` tab near the top middle of the page
- In the left navigation bar click on the name of the workflow `snowflake-devops-demo`
- Click on the `Run workflow` button and then on the green `Run workflow` button in the pop up window (leaving the default branch selected)

![GitHub Actions workflow run page](assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-7.png)

To view the details of a run, click on the name of specific run (you may have to refresh the `Actions` page for it to show up in the list). From the run overview page click on the `deploy-snowflake-changes-job` job and then browse through the output from the various steps. In particular you might want to review the output from the `Run schemachange` step.

![GitHub Actions workflow run output](assets/devops_dcm_schemachange_github-8.png)

Negative
: **Note** - You'll notice that GitHub will automatically redact any secret printed to the log. This is a bit unfortunate as the helpful output from schemachange will only show `***` instead of the actual values. I understand this for sensitive secrets, but for non-sensitive parameter values this is not ideal behaviour. For more details see [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Confirm Changes Deployed to Snowflake
Duration: 4

Now that your first database migration has been deployed to Snowflake, log into your Snowflake account and confirm.

### Database Objects

You should now see a few new objects in your `DEMO_DB` database:

- A new schema `DEMO` and table `HELLO_WORLD` (created by the first migration script from step 4)
- A new schema `SCHEMACHANGE` and table `CHAGE_HISTORY` (created by schemachange to track deployed changes)

Take a look at the contents of the `CHANGE_HISTORY` table to see where/how schemachange keeps track of state. See the [schemachange README](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/schemachange) for more details.

### Query History

From your Snowflake account click on the `History` tab at the top of the window. From there review the queries that were executed by schemachange. In particular, look at the `Query Tag` column to see which queries were issued by schemachange. It even tracks which migration script was responsible for which queries.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create Your Second Database Migration
Duration: 2

In this script you will create your second database migration and have GitHub Actions automatically deploy it to your Snowflake account (no need to manually run the workflow this time)!

Open up your cloned repository in your favorite IDE and create a script named `V1.1.2__updated_objects.sql` (make sure there are two underscores after the version number) in the same `migrations` folder with the following contents:

```sql
USE SCHEMA DEMO;
ALTER TABLE HELLO_WORLD ADD COLUMN AGE NUMBER;
```

Then commit the new script and push the changes to your GitHub repository. Because of the continuous integration trigger we created in the YAML definition, your workflow should have automatically started a new run. Open up the workflow, click on the newest run, then click on the `deploy-snowflake-changes-job` job and browse through the output from the various steps. In particular you might want to review the output from the `Run schemachange` step.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Conclusion & Next Steps
Duration: 4

So now that you’ve got your first Snowflake CI/CD pipeline set up, what’s next? The software development life cycle, including CI/CD pipelines, gets much more complicated in the real-world. Best practices include pushing changes through a series of environments, adopting a branching strategy, and incorporating a comprehensive testing strategy, to name a few.

#### Pipeline Stages
In the real-world you will have multiple stages in your build and release pipelines. A simple, helpful way to think about stages in a deployment pipeline is to think about them as environments, such as dev, test, and prod. Your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file can be extended to include a stage for each of your environments. For more details around how to define stages, please refer to [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

#### Branching Strategy
Branching strategies can be complex, but there are a few popular ones out there that can help get you started. To begin with I would recommend keeping it simple with [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (and see also [an explanation of GitHub flow by Scott Chacon in 2011](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)). Another simple framework to consider is [GitLab flow](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/).

#### Testing Strategy
Testing is an important part of any software development process, and is absolutely critical when it comes to automated software delivery. But testing for databases and data pipelines is complicated and there are many approaches, frameworks, and tools out there. In my opinion, the simplest way to get started testing data pipelines is with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and the [dbt Test features](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/). Another popular Python-based testing tool to consider is [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/).

With that you should now have a working CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions and some helpful ideas for next steps on your DevOps journey with Snowflake. Good luck!
