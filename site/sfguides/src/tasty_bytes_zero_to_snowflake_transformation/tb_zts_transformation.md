## Instantly Clone Production Table for Development
Duration: 1

### Overview
As part of Tasty Bytes truck fleet analysis, our developer has been tasked with 
adding a calculated Truck Age Column to our Truck table. 
 
Being a great developer, we know we cannot develop against a Production table, so we first need to create a Development environment that mimics Production.

### Step 1 - Create a Clone of Production
Thanks to Snowflake's unique architecture, we can instantly create a snapshot of our production `raw_pos.truck` using [CLONE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-clone) functionality and name it `raw_pos.truck_dev`.

Let's now run our next set our queries to set our `tasty_dev` role context and create the table clone noting here that we do not need to set Warehouse context since cloning does not require one.

```
USE ROLE tasty_dev;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev 
    CLONE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck;
```
<img src ="assets/3.1.truck_dev_clone.png">

> aside positive
> **Zero Copy Cloning**: Creates a copy of a database, schema or table. A snapshot of data present in the source object is taken when the clone is created and is made available to the cloned object. 
>The cloned object is writable and is independent of the clone source. That is, changes made to either the source object or the clone object are not part of the other. 
>

### Step 2 - Click Next -->

## Testing Snowflakes Query Result Set Cache
Duration: 1

### Overview
With our Zero Copy Clone instantly available we can now begin to develop against it without any fear of impacting production. However, before we make any changes let's first run some simple queries against it and test out Snowflake's Result Set Cache.

### Step 1 - Querying our Cloned Table
Now that we are going to query our Table, we will need to use our `tasty_dev_wh` Warehouse. 

Let's kick off the next two queries with the second statement producing an result set consisting of our trucks, their years, make and models while making sure we [ORDER BY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/order-by) our `truck_id` Column.

```
USE WAREHOUSE tasty_dev_wh;

SELECT
    t.truck_id,
    t.year,
    t.make,
    t.model
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t
ORDER BY t.truck_id;
```

<img src = "assets/4.1.truck.png">

### Step 2 - Re-Running our Query
To test Snowflake's [Result Set Cache](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-persisted-results), the next query we run will be identical to what we just ran. However, we will now take things a step further and access the Query Profile showcasing this query returned results instantly as the the results came from our Result Set Cache.

After executing the below query, follow the steps in the screenshot to access the [Query Profile](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile). From the Query Profile we will see a single node noting `QUERY RESULT REUSE`.

```
SELECT
    t.truck_id,
    t.year,
    t.make,
    t.model
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t
ORDER BY t.truck_id;
```

<img src = "assets/4.2.1.truck.png">
<img src = "assets/4.2.2.cache.png">

>aside positive
> If a user repeats a query that has already been run, and the data in the table(s) hasnâ€™t changed since the last time that the query was run, then the result of the query is the same. Instead of running the query again, Snowflake simply returns the same result that it returned previously. 
>         
>This can substantially reduce query time because Snowflake bypasses query execution and, instead,retrieves the result directly from the cache.

## Updating Data and Calculating Food Truck Ages
Duration: 1

### Overview
Based on our output above we first need to address the typo in those Ford_ records we saw in our `make` Column. From there, we can begin to work on our calculation that will provide us with the age of each truck.

### Step 1 - Updating Incorrect Values in a Column
To begin this section, let's make sure we correct the typo by executing our next query which leverages [UPDATE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/update) to change rows in our `truck_dev` [WHERE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/where) the make is equal to Ford_.

```
UPDATE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev 
SET make = 'Ford' 
WHERE make = 'Ford_';
```

<img src = "assets/5.1.ford_.png">

### Step 2 - Building an Age Calculation
With the typo handled, we can now calculate the age in years of the trucks within our fleet. Please execute the next query where we will see [YEAR](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/year) and [CURRENT_DATE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/current_date) leveraged to assist in this calculation.

```
SELECT
    t.truck_id,
    t.year,
    t.make,
    t.model,
    (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) - t.year) AS truck_age_year
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t;
```

<img src = "assets/5.2.age.png">

### Step 3 - Click Next -->

## Adding a Column and Updating it
Duration: 1

### Overview
With our Truck Age in Years calculation done and dusted, let's now add a new Column to our Cloned Table to support it and finish things off by updating the Column to reflect the calculated values.

### Step 1 - Adding a Column to a Table
To start, please execute the next query which uses [ALTER TABLE... ADD COLUMN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) to
create an empty `truck_age` column of [Data Type NUMBER](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-numeric) to our `truck_dev` table. 

This query will provide a `Statement executed successfully` result.

```
ALTER TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev
    ADD COLUMN truck_age NUMBER(4);
```

### Step 2 - Adding Calculated Values to our Column
With the column in place, we can kick off the next query which will [UPDATE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/update) the new, empty `truck_age` column using the Truck Age calculation we built in the previous section.
```
UPDATE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t
    SET truck_age = (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) / t.year);
```
<img src = "assets/6.2.update.png">

### Step 3 - Querying our new Column
After successfully updating the data, let's now run a quick query against the table to see how things look in our `truck_age` column.
```
SELECT
    t.truck_id,
    t.year,
    t.truck_age
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t;
```
<img src = "assets/6.3.bad_data.png">

**Uh oh!** Thank goodness we were smart developers and didn't do this sort of thing blindly in production. 

It looks like we messed up the `truck_age` calculation and had it doing division instead of subtraction.  We will need to resolve this in our next section.

### Step 4 - Click Next -->

## Utilizing Time Travel for Data Disaster Recovery
Duration: 1

### Overview
Although we made an mistake, Snowflake has many features that can help get us out of trouble here. The process we will take will leverage Query History, SQL Variables and Time Travel to revert our `truck_dev` Table back to what it looked like prior to that incorrect pdate statement.

>aside positive
> Time Travel enables accessing historical data (i.e. data that has been changed or deleted) at any point within a defined period.
>

### Step 1 - Leveraging Query History
To start our recovery process, kick off the next query which will use the Snowflake [QUERY_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/query_history) function to retrieve a list of all update statements we have made against our `truck_dev` Table.
```
SELECT 
    query_id,
    query_text,
    user_name,
    query_type,
    start_time
FROM TABLE(frostbyte_tasty_bytes.information_schema.query_history())
WHERE 1=1
    AND query_type = 'UPDATE'
    AND query_text LIKE '%frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev%'
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```
<img src = "assets/7.1.query_history.png">

### Step 2 - Setting a SQL Variable
As expected, we see our typo correction as well as our bad calculation update and their associated unique query_id's. Please run the next query which creates a `query_id` SQL Variable that we will use to revert our changes via Time-Travel in the next step. 

After execution you will recieve a `Statement executed successfully` result.
```
SET query_id = 
(
    SELECT TOP 1 query_id
    FROM TABLE(frostbyte_tasty_bytes.information_schema.query_history())
    WHERE 1=1
        AND query_type = 'UPDATE'
        AND query_text LIKE '%SET truck_age = (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) / t.year);'
    ORDER BY start_time DESC
);
```

### Step 3 - Leveraging Time-Travel to Revert our Table
With our bad query_id stored as a Variable, we can execute the next query which will replace our `truck_dev` Table with what it looked like [BEFORE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/at-before) the incorrect query_id statement using Time-Travel. 

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev
    AS 
SELECT * FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev
BEFORE(STATEMENT => $query_id); 

```
<img src = "assets/7.3.time_travel.png">

Please refer to the list below for the other Time-Travel Statement options available.
>aside positive
>**AT:** The AT keyword specifies that the request is inclusive of any changes made by a statement or transaction with timestamp equal to the specified parameter.
>
>**BEFORE:** The BEFORE keyword specifies that the request refers to a point immediately preceding the specified parameter.
>
>**TIMESTAMP:** Specifies an exact date and time to use for Time Travel.
>
>**OFFSET:** Specifies the difference in seconds from the current time to use for Time Travel.
>
>**STATEMENT:** Specifies the query ID of a statement to use as the reference point for Time Travel.
>

## Promoting Development to Production
Duration: 1

### Overview
With our `truck_dev` Table back to the state it was before our incorrect update statement, we can now make sure the column is correctly updated. From there we will promote our Table with the correct calculation to Production to complete our assigned task.

### Step 1 - Adding Correctly Calculated Values to our Column
Using the same process as before, please run the next query making sure we now double check we are using subtraction instead of division.

```
UPDATE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev t
SET truck_age = (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) - t.year);
```

<img src = "assets/8.1.correct_update.png">

### Step 2 - Swapping our Development Table with Production
With everything complete in `truck_dev` please kick off the next two queries where we first assume the more privileged `sysadmin` role. As a `sysadmin` the second query utilizes [ALTER TABLE... SWAP WITH](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-table) to promote our `truck_dev` table to `truck` and vice versa.

Once complete you will recieve a  `Statement executed successfully.` result.

```
USE ROLE sysadmin;

ALTER TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev 
    SWAP WITH frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck;
```

### Step 3 - Validate Production
To confirm our process was successful, let's now take a look at the Production `truck` table so we can validate the swap was successful and the `truck_age` results are valid.

```
SELECT
    t.truck_id,
    t.year,
    t.truck_age
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck t
WHERE t.make = 'Ford';

```

<img src = "assets/8.3.validate_prod.png">

### Step 4 - Click Next -->

## Dropping and Undropping Tables
Duration: 1

### Overview
We can officially say our developer has completed their assigned task. With the `truck_age` column in place and correctly calulated, our `sysadmin` can 
clean up the left over Table and sign off for the day.

### Step 1 - Dropping a Table
To remove the Table from our Database, please execute the next query which leverages [DROP TABLE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/drop-table).

```
DROP TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck;
```

<img src = "assets/9.1.drop.png">

**Uh oh!!** That result set shows that even our `sysadmin` can make mistakes. We incorrectly dropped production `truck` and not development `truck_dev`! Thankfully, Snowflake's Time-Travel can come to the rescue again.

### Step 2 - Undropping a Table
Hurry up and run the next query before any systems are impacted which will [UNDROP](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table) the `truck` table.

```
UNDROP TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck;
```

<img src = "assets/9.2.undrop.png">

### Step 3 - Dropping the Correct Table
Alright, now let's officially close things out by running the final query to correctly drop `truck_dev`.

```
DROP TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes.raw_pos.truck_dev;
```

<img src = "assets/9.3.correctdrop.png">
