# Leverage dbt Cloud to Generate ML ready pipelines using snowpark python
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 3

The focus of this workshop will be to demonstrate how we can use both *SQL and python together* in the same workflow to run *both analytics and machine learning models* on dbt Cloud.

All code in today’s workshop can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbt-labs/python-snowpark-formula1/tree/python-formula1).

### What you'll need to setup for the lab

- A [Snowflake account](https://trial.snowflake.com/) with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 

### What you'll learn
- How to use dbt with Snowflake to build scalable transformations using SQL and Python
- How to use dbt SQL to prepare your data from sources to encoding 
- How to train a model in dbt python and use it for future prediction 
- How to deploy your full project 

### What you need to know

- Basic to intermediate SQL and python.
- Basic understanding of dbt fundamentals. We recommend the [dbt Fundamentals course](https://courses.getdbt.com/collections) if you're interested.
- High level machine learning process (encoding, training, testing)
- Simple ML algorithms &mdash; we will use logistic regression to keep the focus on the *workflow*, not algorithms!

- *Bonus: if you have completed [this dbt workshop](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/accelerating_data_teams_with_snowflake_and_dbt_cloud_hands_on_lab/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) to have hands on keyboard practice with concepts like the source, ref, tests, and docs in dbt. By having completed that workshop, you will gain the most of this dbt python + snowpark workshop.

### What you'll build

- A set of data analytics and prediction pipelines using Formula 1 data leveraging dbt and Snowflake, making use of best practices and code promotion between environments. 
- We will create insights for:
    1. Finding the lap time average and rolling average through the years
    2. Predicting the position of each driver based on a decade of data

As inputs, we are going to leverage Formula 1 datasets hosted on a dbt Labs public S3 bucket. We will create a Snowflake Stage for our CSV files then use Snowflake’s `COPY INTO` function to copy the data in from our CSV files into tables. The Formula 1 is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). The data is originally compiled from the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/). We will not be building the full pipeline as part of this workshop. Instead we will leverage an exisitng repo, fork it, and focus on our machine learning pipeline.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Architecture and use case overview
Duration: 2 

In this lab we'll be transforming raw Formula 1 data into a consumable form for both BI tools and machine learning pipeline. To understand how this data is related, we've included an entity relationship diagram of the tables we'll be using today. 
At a high level the way we are able to do this is that dbt is able to invoke python models as stored procedures from Snowpark for python. Snowflake's new snowpark capabilities and dbt's python support make this all possible.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Configure Snowflake
Duration: 5

In this section we’re going to sign up for a Snowflake trial account and enable Anaconda-provided Python packages.

1. [Sign up for a Snowflake Trial Account using this form](https://signup.snowflake.com/). Ensure that your account is set up using **AWS**.

2. After creating your account and verifying it from your sign-up email, Snowflake will direct you back to the UI called Snowsight.

3. When Snowsight first opens, your window should look like the following, with you logged in as the ACCOUNTADMIN with demo worksheets open:
![new_snowflake_account](assets/configure-snowflake/2-new-snowflake-account.png)

4. Navigate to **Admin > Billing & Terms**. Click **Enable > Acknowledge & Continue** to enable Anaconda Python Packages to run in Snowflake.
![enable-anaconda](assets/configure-snowflake/4-enable-anaconda.jpeg)
![accept-anaconda-terms](assets/configure-snowflake/3-accept-anaconda-terms.jpeg)


5. Finally, navigate back to **Worksheets** to create a new SQL Worksheet by selecting **+** then **SQL Worksheet** in the upper right corner.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Load data into Snowflake
Duration: 7

We need to obtain our data source by copying our Formula 1 data into Snowflake tables from a public S3 bucket that dbt Labs hosts. 

1. Your new Snowflake account has a preconfigured warehouse named `COMPUTE_WH`. If for some reason you don’t have this warehouse, we can create a warehouse using the following script:

    ```sql
    create or replace warehouse COMPUTE_WH with warehouse_size=XSMALL
    ```
2. Rename the SQL worksheet by clicking the worksheet name (this is automatically set to the current timestamp) using the option **…** and **Rename**. Rename the file  to `data setup script` since we will be placing code in this worksheet to ingest the Formula 1 data. Make sure your role is set as the **ACCOUNTADMIN** and select the **COMPUTE_WH** warehouse.
![rename-worksheet-and-select-warehouse](assets/load-data-into-snowflake/1-rename-worksheet-and-select-warehouse.png)

3. Copy the following code into the main body of the Snowflake SQL worksheet. You can also find this setup script under the `setup` folder in the [Git repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/python-snowpark-formula1/blob/main/setup/setup_script_s3_to_snowflake.sql). The script is long since it's bringing in all of the data we'll need today! Generally during this lab we'll be explaining and breaking down the queries. We won't going line by line, but we will point out important information related to our learning objectives!
    ```sql
    /*
    This is our setup script to create a new database for the Formula1 data in Snowflake.
    We are copying data from a public s3 bucket into snowflake by defining our csv format and snowflake stage.

    on_error='continue';
    ```

4. Ensure all the commands are selected before running the query &mdash; an easy way to do this is to use Ctrl-A to highlight all of the code in the worksheet. Select **run** (blue triangle icon). Notice how the dot next to your **COMPUTE_WH** turns from gray to green as you run the query. The **status** table is the final table of all 14 tables loaded in. 
![load-data-from-s3](assets/load-data-into-snowflake/2-load-data-from-s3.png)

5. Let’s unpack that pretty long query we ran into component parts. We ran this query to load in our 14 Formula 1 tables from a public S3 bucket. To do this, we:
- Created a new database called `formula1` and a schema called `raw` to place our raw (untransformed) data into. 
- Created a stage to locate our data we are going to load in. Snowflake Stages are locations where data files are stored. Stages are used to both load and unload data to and from Snowflake locations. Here we are using an external stage, by referencing an S3 bucket. 
- Created our tables for our data to be copied into. These are empty tables with the column name and data type. Think of this as creating an empty container that the data will then fill into. 
- Used the `copy into` statement for each of our tables. We reference our staged location we created and upon loading errors continue to load in the rest of the data. You should not have data loading errors but if you do, those rows will be skipped and Snowflake will tell you which rows caused errors. 

6. Now let's take a look at some of our cool Formula 1 data we just loaded up!
- Create a SQL worksheet by selecting the **+** then **SQL Worksheet**.
![create-new-worksheet-to-query-data](assets/load-data-into-snowflake/3-create-new-worksheet-to-query-data.png)

- Navigate to **Database > Formula1 > RAW > Tables**. 
- Query the data using the following code. There are only 77 rows in the circuits table, so we don’t need to worry about limiting the amount of data we query.
    ```sql
    select * from formula1.raw.circuits
    ```
- Run the query. From here on out, we’ll use the keyboard shortcuts Command-Enter or Control-Enter to run queries and won’t explicitly call out this step. 
- Review the query results, you should see information about Formula 1 circuits, starting with Albert Park in Australia! 
- Ensure you have all 14 tables starting with `CIRCUITS` and ending with `STATUS`. Now we are ready to connect into dbt Cloud!
![query-circuits-data](assets/load-data-into-snowflake/4-query-circuits-data.png)

We're ready to setup our dbt account!

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setup dbt account 
Duration: 2

We are going to be using [Snowflake Partner Connect](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ecosystem-partner-connect.html) to set up a dbt Cloud account. Using this method will allow you to spin up a fully fledged dbt account with your [Snowflake connection](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-snowflake) and environments already established.

1. Navigate out of your SQL worksheet back by selecting **home**.
2. In Snowsight, confirm that you are using the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role.
3. Navigate to the **Admin** **> Partner Connect**. Find **dbt** either by using the search bar or navigating the **Data Integration**. Select the **dbt** tile.
<img src="assets/setup-dbt-account/1-open-partner-connect.png" alt="open-partner-connect">

4. You should now see a new window that says **Connect to dbt**. Select **Optional Grant** and add the `FORMULA1` database. This will grant access for your new dbt user role to the FORMULA1 database.
<img src="assets/setup-dbt-account/2-partner-connect-optional-grant.png" alt="partner-connect-optional-grant">

5. Ensure the `FORMULA1` is present in your optional grant before clicking **Connect**.  This will create a dedicated dbt user, database, warehouse, and role for your dbt Cloud trial.
<img src="assets/setup-dbt-account/3-connect-to-dbt.png" alt="connect-to-dbt">

6. When you see the **Your partner account has been created** window, click **Activate**.

7. You should be redirected to a dbt Cloud registration page. Fill out the form using whatever account name you'd like. Make sure to save the password somewhere for login in the future. 
<img src="assets/setup-dbt-account/4-dbt-cloud-sign-up.png" alt="dbt-cloud-sign-up">

8. Select **Complete Registration**. You should now be redirected to your dbt Cloud account, complete with a connection to your Snowflake account, a deployment and a development environment, and a sample job.

Instead of building an entire version controlled data project from scratch, we'll be forking and connecting to an existing workshop github repository in the next step. dbt Cloud's git integration creates easy to use git guardrails. You won't need to know much Git for this workshop. In the future, if you’re developing your own proof of value project from scratch, [feel free to use dbt's managed  repository](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository) that is spun up during partner connect. 


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Development schema and forking repo
Duration: 10

In this section we'll be setting up our own personal development schema and forking our workshop repo into dbt Cloud. 

### Schema name
1. First we are going to change the name of our default schema to where our dbt models will build. By default, the name of your development schema might be`dbt_`. We will change this to `dbt_<YOUR_NAME>` to create your own personal development schema. To do this, select **User Profile > Credentials**. If this was already setup to your liking based off your dbt Cloud account name feel free to keep it as is. Knowing how to configure schema names is also helpful when you onboard multiple team members onto dbt cloud and want each person to have their own development schema! 
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/schema-name/1-profile-credentials-dbt-cloud.png" alt="profile-credentials-dbt-cloud">

2. Select **Partner Connect Trial**, which will expand the credentials menu.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/schema-name/2-credentials-edit-schema-name.png" alt="credentials-edit-schema-name">
    
3. Click **Edit** and change the name of your schema from `dbt_` to `dbt_YOUR_NAME` replacing `YOUR_NAME` with your initials and name (`hwatson` is used in the lab screenshots). Be sure to click **Save** for your changes!
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/schema-name/3-save-new-schema-name.png" alt="save-new-schema-name">

We now have our own personal development schema, amazing! When we run our first dbt models they will build into this schema.

### Forking repo 

To keep the focus on dbt python and deployment today, we only want to build a subset of models that would be in an entire data project. To achieve this we need to fork an existing repository into our personal github, copy our forked repo name into dbt cloud, and add the dbt deploy key to our github account. Viola! There will be some back and forth between dbt cloud and GitHub as part of this process, so keep your tabs open, and let's get the setup out of the way!

1. Delete the existing connection to the managed repository. To do this navigate to **Settings > Account Settings > Partner Connect Trial**.
2. This will open the **Project Details**. Navigate to **Repository** and click the existing managed repository GitHub connection setup during partner connect.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/1-select-partner-connect-repo.png" alt="select-existing-partner-connect-repo">

3. In the **Respository Details** select **Edit** in the lower right corner. The option to **Disconnect** will appear, select it.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/2_repository_details_disconnect.png" alt="repository_details_disconnect">

4. **Confirm disconnect**. 
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/3_confirm_disconnect_from_managed_repo.png" alt="confirm_disconnect_from_managed_repo">

5. Within your **Project Details** you should have the option to **Configure Repository**.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/4_configure_repository.png" alt="configure_repository">

6. Open a new browser tab for [GitHub](https://github.com/). Login to your personal GitHub account. 
7. Using the search bar, find today's demo repo by searching **dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake-summit-2023-hands-on-lab-snowpark**
8. **Fork** your own copy of the lab repo.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/5_fork_exisiting_formula1_repo.png" alt="fork_exisiting_formula1_repo">

9. Add a description if you'd like such as: "learning about dbt at Snowflake Summit is cool" and **Create fork**.  
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/6_create_new_fork.png" alt="create_new_fork">

10. Select the **Code** button. Choose the SSH option and use the copy button shortcut for our repo. 
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/7_copy_repo_ssh_github.png" alt="copy_repo_ssh_github">

11. **Navigate back to dbt cloud**. After deleting our partner connect managed repository, we should see **New Repository**. Select **Git Clone**. Input the repository by pasting what you copied from GitHub into the **Repository** parameter. 
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/8_git_clone_copy_repo_from_github.png" alt="git_clone_copy_repo_from_github">

12. We can see we successfully made the connection to our forked GitHub repo. <img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/forking-repo/9_update_dbt_cloud_repo_connection_with_forked_repo.png" alt="update_dbt_cloud_repo_connection_with_forked_repo"> 

If you tried to start developing onto of this repo right now, we'd get permissions errors. So we need to give dbt Cloud write acess. 

### Giving dbt cloud repo write access using github deploy keys
1. Click on your git cloned repository link. dbt Cloud generated a deploy key to link the development we do in dbt cloud back to our GitHub repo. **Copy** the deploy key starting with **ssh-rsa** followed by a long hash key (full key hidden for privacy).
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/copy_deploy_key_from_dbt_cloud.png" alt="copy_deploy_key_from_dbt_cloud">

2. Phew almost there! Navigate **back to GitHub** again. 
3. Ensure you're in your forked repo. Navigate to your repo **Settings**
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/git_repo_settings.png" alt="git_repo_settings">

4. Go to **Deploy keys**. 
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/deploy_keys_github.png" alt="deploy_keys_github">

5. Select **Add deploy key**. <img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/new_deploy_key_button.png" alt="new_deploy_key_button">

6. Give your deploy key a title such as `dbt Cloud Snowflake Summit`. Paste the key we ssh-rsa deploy key we copied from dbt Cloud into the **Key** box. Be sure to enable **Allow write access**. Finally, **Add key**. Your deploy key has been created. We won't have to come back to again GitHub until the end of our workshop.

<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/deploy_key_created.png" alt="deploy_key_created">

7. Head back over to dbt cloud. Navigate to **Develop**.
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/develop_panel_dbt_cloud.png" alt="develop_panel_dbt_cloud">

8. **Run "dbt deps"**
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/run_dep_deps_after_importing_forked_repo.png" alt="run_dep_deps_after_importing_forked_repo">

<!-- possible TODO: might need to update this to not yet create new branch -->
9. Since we're brining in an existing project your root folder should now say `dbt-snowflake-summit-hands-on-lab-snowpark`
<img src="assets/development-schema-and-forking-repo/github-deploy-keys/file_tree_of_forked_repo.png" alt="file_tree_of_forked_repo">

Alas, now that our setup work is complete, time get a look at our data pipeline! 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## IDE overview and buidling first dbt models
Duration: 5

dbt Cloud's IDE will be our development space for this workshop, so let's get familiar with it. Once we've done that we'll run the pipeline we imported from our forked repo. 

1. There are a couple of key features to point out about the IDE before we get to work. It is a text editor, an SQL and Python runner, and a CLI with Git version control all baked into one package! This allows you to focus on editing your SQL and Python files, previewing the results with the SQL runner (it even runs Jinja!), and building models at the command line without having to move between different applications. The Git workflow in dbt Cloud allows both Git beginners and experts alike to be able to easily version control all of their work with a couple clicks.
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/1-ide-overview.png" alt="ide-overview">

2. Let's run the pipeline we imported from our forked repo. Type `dbt build` into the command line and select **Enter** on your keyboard. When the run bar expands you'll be able to see the results of the run, where you should see the run complete successfully. 
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/2_dbt_build_initial_pipeline_ml.png" alt="dbt_build_initial_pipeline_ml"> 
To understand more about what the [dbt build](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/build) syntax is running check out the documentation.

3. You can look at the run results of each model to see the code that dbt compiles and sends to Snowflake for execution. Select the arrow beside a model **>**. Click **Details** and view the ouput. We can see that dbt automatically generates the DDL statement and is creating our models in our development schema (i.e. `dbt_hwatson`).
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/3_model_details_ddl.png" alt="model_details_ddl">

4. In the file tree select **models > ml > training_and_prediction > hold_out_dataset_for_prediction.py**. Click the **Lineage** tab. This is a bit small. To make it full screen click the viewfinder icon. 
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/4_lineage_viewfinder.png" alt="lineage_viewfinder">

5. Explore the DAG for a few minutes to understand everything we've done to our pipeline along the way. This includes: cleaning up and joining our data, machine learning data prep, variable encoding, and splitting the datasets. We'll go more in-depth in next steps about how we brought in raw data and then transformed it, but for now get an overall familiarization. 
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/5_lineage_fullview.png" alt="lineage_fullview"> You can view the code in each node of the DAG by selecting it and navigating out of the full screen. You can read the code on the scratchpad. 

6. Now let's switch over to a new browser tab **on Snowflake** to confirm that the objects were actually created. Click on the three dots **…** above your database objects and then **Refresh**. Expand the **PC_DBT_DB** database and you should see your development schema. Select the schema, then **Tables**  and **Views**. Now you should be able to see many models we created from our forked repo. 
<img src="assets/ide-overview-first-models/6_confirm_pipeline_build_in_snowflake.png" alt="confirm_pipeline_build_in_snowflake">

We did a lot upstream in our forked repo and we'll explore it at a high level of how we did that before moving on to machine learning model training and prediction in dbt cloud. 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Understanding our existing pipeline 
Duration: 5

We brought a good chunk of our data pipeline in through our forked repo to lay a foundation for machine learning.
In the next couple steps we are taking time to review how this was done. That way when you have your own dbt project you'll be familiar with the setup! We'll start with the dbt_project.yml, sources, and staging. 


### dbt_project.yml
1. Select the `dbt_project.yml` file in the root directory the file explorer to open it. What are we looking at here? Every dbt project requires a `dbt_project.yml` file &mdash; this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. The [dbt_project.yml](/reference/dbt_project.yml) file also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate on your project.
2. Your code should as follows: 
    ```yaml
    name: 'snowflake_python_workshop'
    version: '1.5.0'
    require-dbt-version: '>=1.3.0'
    config-version: 2

    # This setting configures which "profile" dbt uses for this project.
    profile: 'default'

    # These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
    # The `source-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be
    # found in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!
    model-paths: ["models"]
    analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
    test-paths: ["tests"]
    seed-paths: ["seeds"]
    macro-paths: ["macros"]
    snapshot-paths: ["snapshots"]

    target-path: "target"  # directory which will store compiled SQL files
    clean-targets:         # directories to be removed by `dbt clean`
        - "target"
        - "dbt_packages"

    models:
        snowflake_python_workshop:
        staging:
            +docs:
            node_color: "CadetBlue"

        marts:
            +materialized: table
            aggregates:
            +docs:
                node_color: "Maroon"
            +tags: "bi"

        core:
            +materialized: table
            +docs:
            node_color: "#800080"

        ml:
            +materialized: table
            prep_encoding_splitting:
            +docs:
                node_color: "Indigo"
            training_and_prediction:
            +docs:
                node_color: "Black"
    ```

3. The key configurations to point out in the file with relation to the work that we're going to do are in the `models` section.
    - `require-dbt-version` &mdash; Tells dbt which version of dbt to use for your project. We are requiring 1.3.0 and any newer version to run python models and node colors.
    - `materialized` &mdash; Tells dbt how to materialize models when compiling the code before it pushes it down to Snowflake. All models in the `marts` folder will be built as tables.
    - `tags` &mdash; Applies tags at a directory level to all models. All models in the `aggregates` folder will be tagged as `bi` (abbreviation for business intelligence).
4. [Materializations](/docs/build/materializations) are strategies for persisting dbt models in a warehouse, with `tables` and `views` being the most commonly utilized types. By default, all dbt models are materialized as views and other materialization types can be configured in the `dbt_project.yml` file or in a model itself. It’s very important to note *Python models can only be materialized as tables or incremental models.* Since all our Python models exist under `marts`, the following portion of our `dbt_project.yml` ensures no errors will occur when we run our Python models. Starting with [dbt version 1.4](/guides/migration/versions/upgrading-to-v1.4#updates-to-python-models), Python files will automatically get materialized as tables even if not explicitly specified.

    ```yaml 
    marts:     
      +materialized: table
    ``` 

Cool, now that dbt knows we have a dbt project we can view the folder structure and data modeling.  

### Folder structure 
dbt Labs has developed a [project structure guide](/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview/) that contains a number of recommendations for how to build the folder structure for your project. These apply to our entire project except the machine learning portion - this is still relatively new use case in dbt without the same established best practices. 

Do check out that guide if you want to learn more. Right now we are going to organize our project using the following structure:
- sources &mdash; This is our Formula 1 dataset and it will be defined in a source YAML file. Nested under our Staging folder. 
- staging models &mdash; These models have a 1:1 with their source table and are for light transformation (renaming columns, recasting data types, etc.).
- core models &mdash; Fact and dimension tables available for end user analysis. Since the Formula 1 is pretty clean demo data these look similar to our staging models. 
- marts models &mdash; Here is where we perform our major transformations. It contains the subfolder:
    - aggregates
- ml :
    - prep_encoding_splitting
    - training_and_prediction (we'll be creating this folder later &mdash; it doesn't exist yet )

Your folder structure should look like (make sure to expand some folders if necessary):
<img src="assets/understanding-our-existing-pipeline/folder_structure.png" alt="folder_structure">

Remember you can always reference the entire project in [GitHub](https://github.com/dbt-labs/python-snowpark-formula1) to view the complete folder and file strucutre.  

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data modeling -- sources and staging 
Duration: 3

In any data project we start with raw data, clean and transform, and gain insights. In this step we'll be showing you how to bring raw data into dbt and create staging models. The steps of setting up sources and staging models were completed when we forked our repo, so we'll only need to preview these files (instead of build them).

Sources allow us to create a dependency between our source database object and our staging models which will help us when we look at [data-lineage](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/data-lineage) later. Also, if your source changes database or schema, you only have to update it in your `f1_sources.yml` file rather than updating all of the models it might be used in.

Staging models are the base of our project, where we bring all the individual components we're going to use to build our more complex and useful models into the project. Staging models have a 1:1 relationship with their source table and are for light transformation steps such as renaming columns, type casting, basic computations, and categorizing data. 

Since we want to focus on dbt and Python in this workshop, check out our [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources) and [staging](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) docs if you want to learn more (or take our [dbt Fundamentals](https://courses.getdbt.com/collections) course which covers all of our core functionality).

### Creating Sources 
1. Open the file called `f1_sources.yml` with the following file path: `models/staging/formula1/f1_sources.yml`.
2. You should see the following code that creates our 14 source tables in our dbt project from Snowflake:
<img src="assets/data-modeling-sources-and-staging/sources_f1.png" alt="sources_f1">


3. dbt makes it really easy to:
    - declare [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources)
    - provide [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests) for data quality and integrity with support for both generic and singular tests 
    - create [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation) using descriptions where you write code

Now that we are connected into our raw data let's do some light transformations in staging. 

### Staging 
1. Let's view two staging models that we'll be using to understand lap time trends through the years. 
2. Open `stg_lap_times`. 
    ```sql
    with

    lap_times as (select * from {{ source('formula1', 'lap_times') }}),

    renamed as (
        select
            race_id as race_id,
            driver_id as driver_id,
            lap,
            "POSITION" as driver_position,
            "TIME" as lap_time_formatted,
            {{ convert_laptime("lap_time_formatted") }} as official_laptime,
            milliseconds as lap_time_milliseconds
        from lap_times
    )
    select
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(["race_id", "driver_id", "lap"]) }}
        as lap_times_id,
        *
    from renamed
    ```

3. Review the SQL code. We see renaming columns using the alias in addition to reformatting using a jinja code in our project referencing a macro. At a high level a macro is a reusable piece of code and jinja is the way we can bring that code into our SQL model. Datetimes column formatting is usually tricky and repetitive. By using a macro we introduce a way to systematic format times and reduce redunant code in our Formula 1 project. Select **</> Compile** once its finished view the **Compiled Code tab**. 
<img src="assets/data-modeling-sources-and-staging/compiled_jinja_lap_times.png" alt="compiled_jinja_lap_times">

4. Now click **Preview** &mdash; look how pretty and human readable our `official_laptime` column is!
5. Feel free to view our project macros under the root folder `macros` and look at the code for our convert_laptime macro in the `convert_laptim.sql` file. 
6. We can see the reusable logic we have for splitting apart different components of our lap times from hours to nanoseconds. If you want to learn more about leveraging macros within dbt SQL, check out our [macros documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros). 
<!-- 7. TODO talk about surrogate_key and dbt_utils -->

You can see for every source table, we have a staging table. Now that we're done staging our data it's time for transformation.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## SQL Transformations 
Duration: 5

dbt got it's start in being a powerful tool to enhance the way data transformations are done in SQL. Before we jump into python, let's pay homage to SQL. <br>
SQL is so performant at data cleaning and transformation, that many data science projects "use SQL for everything you can, then hand off to python" and that's exactly what we're going to do. 

### Fact and dimension tables 
[Dimensional modeling](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dimensional-modeling) is an important data modeling concept where we break up data into "facts" and "dimensions" to organize and describe data. We won't go into depth here, but think of facts as "skinny and long" transactional tables and dimensions as "wide" referential tables. We'll preview one dimension table and be building one fact table. 

1. Create a new branch so we can build new models (our main branch is protected as read-only in dbt Cloud). Name your branch `snowpark-python-workshop`. 
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/create_branch_dbt_cloud.png" alt="create_branch_dbt_cloud">
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/name_branch_dbt_cloud.png" alt="name_branch_dbt_cloud">

2. Navigate in the file tree to **models > marts > core > dim_races**. 
3. **Preview** the data. We can see we have the `RACE_YEAR` in this table. That's important since we want to understand the changes in lap times over years. So we now know `dim_races` contains the time column we need to make those calculations. 
<!-- TODO SCREENSHOT OF PREVIEWED DATA  -->
4. Create a new file within the **core** directory **core > ... > Create file**.
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/create_fct_file.png" alt="create_fct_file">
 
5. Name the file `fct_lap_times.sql`.
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/fct_lap_times.png" alt="fct_lap_times">

6. Copy in the following code and save the file (**Save** or Ctrl+S):
    ```sql
    with lap_times as (
        select 
            {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['race_id', 'driver_id', 'lap']) }} as lap_times_id,
            race_id                                                                 as race_id,
            driver_id                                                               as driver_id,
            lap                                                                     as lap,
            driver_position                                                         as driver_position,
            lap_time_formatted                                                      as lap_time_formatted,
            official_laptime                                                        as official_laptime,
            lap_time_milliseconds                                                   as lap_time_milliseconds
        from {{ ref('stg_lap_times') }}
    )
    select * from lap_times
    ```
7. Our `fct_lap_times` is very similar to our staging file since this is clean demo data. In your real world data project your data will probably be messier and require extra filtering and aggregation prior to becoming a fact table exposed to your business users for utilizing.
8. Use the UI **Build** (buttom with hammer icon) to create the `fct_lap_times` model. 
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/dbt_build_fct_lap_times.png" alt="dbt_build_fct_lap_times">

Now we have both `dim_races` and `fct_lap_times` separately. Next we'll to join these to create lap trend analysis through the years.

### Marts tables
Marts tables are where everything comes together to create our business-defined entities that have an identity and purpose. 
We'll be joining our `dim_races` and `fct_lap_times` together. 

1. Create a new file under your **marts** folder called `mrt_lap_times_years.sql`.
2. Copy and **Save** the following code:
    ```sql
    with lap_times as (
    select * from {{ ref('fct_lap_times') }}
        ),
        races as (
        select * from {{ ref('dim_races') }}
        ),
        expanded_lap_times_by_year as (
            select 
                lap_times.race_id, 
                driver_id, 
                race_year,
                lap,
                lap_time_milliseconds 
            from lap_times
            left join races
                on lap_times.race_id = races.race_id
            where lap_time_milliseconds is not null 
        )
        select * from expanded_lap_times_by_year
    ```
<!-- TODO ADD SCREENSHOT OF MART  -->
3. Our dataset contains races going back to 1950, but the measurement of lap times begins in 1996. Here we join our datasets together use our `where` clause to filter our races prior to 1996, so they have lap times. 
4. Execute the model using **Build**. 
5. **Preview** your new model. We have race years and lap times together in one joined table so we are ready to create our trend analysis. 
6. It's a good time to commit the 2 new models we created in our repository. Click **Commit and sync** and add a commit message. 
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/commit_and_sync_fct_mrt.png" alt="commit_and_sync_fct_mrt">
<img src="assets/sql-transformations/commit_message_fct_mrt.png" alt="commit_message_fct_mrt">

Now that we've joined and denormalized our data we're ready to use it in python development. 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Python development in snowflake python worksheets 
Duration: 5

Now that we've transformed data using SQL let's write our first python code and get insights about lap time trends.
Snowflake python worksheets are excellent for developing your python code before bringing it into a dbt python model.
Then once we are settled on the code we want, we can drop it into our dbt project. 

[Python worksheets](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/python-worksheets) in Snowflake are a dynamic and interactive environment for executing Python code directly within Snowflake's cloud data platform. They provide a seamless integration between Snowflake's powerful data processing capabilities and the versatility of Python as a programming language. With Python worksheets, users can easily perform data transformations, analytics, and visualization tasks using familiar Python libraries and syntax, all within the Snowflake ecosystem. These worksheets enable data scientists, analysts, and developers to streamline their workflows, explore data in real-time, and derive valuable insights from their Snowflake data.

1. Head back over **to Snowflake**.
2. Open up a **Python Worksheet**. Ensure you have selected your worksheet to run 
<img src="assets/python-development/create_python_worksheet.png" alt="create_python_worksheet">

3. Ensure you are in your development database and schema (i.e. **PC_DBT_DB** and **DBT_HWATSON**) and run the Python worksheet (Ctrl+A and **Run**).
<img src="assets/python-development/python_worksheet_db_schema.png" alt="python_worksheet_db_schema">

4. Delete the same code in the new worksheet. Use the following code to get a 5 year moving average of Formula 1 laps:
    ```python
    # The Snowpark package is required for Python Worksheets. 
    # You can add more packages by selecting them using the Packages control and then importing them.

    import snowflake.snowpark as snowpark
    import pandas as pd 

    def main(session: snowpark.Session): 
        # Your code goes here, inside the "main" handler.
        tableName = 'MRT_LAP_TIMES_YEARS'
        dataframe = session.table(tableName)
        lap_times = dataframe.to_pandas()

        # print table
        print(lap_times)

        # describe the data
        lap_times["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"] = lap_times["LAP_TIME_MILLISECONDS"]/1000
        lap_time_trends = lap_times.groupby(by="RACE_YEAR")["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"].mean().to_frame()
        lap_time_trends.reset_index(inplace=True)
        lap_time_trends["LAP_MOVING_AVG_5_YEARS"] = lap_time_trends["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"].rolling(5).mean()
        lap_time_trends.columns = lap_time_trends.columns.str.upper()

        final_df = session.create_dataframe(lap_time_trends)
        # Return value will appear in the Results tab.
        return final_df
    ```

5. Your result should have three columns: `race_year`, `lap_time_seconds`, and `lap_moving_avg_5_years`. 
<img src="assets/python-development/lap_times_5yr_avg.png" alt="lap_times_5yr_avg"> This dataframe is in great shape for visualization in a downstream BI tool or application. We were able to quickly calculate a 5 year moving average using python instead of having to sort our data and worry about lead and lag SQL commands. At a glance we can see that lap times seem to be trending down with small fluctuations until 2010 and 2011 which coincides with drastic Formula 1 [regulation changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Formula_One_regulations) including cost-cutting measures and in-race refuelling bans. So we can safely ascertain lap times are not consistently decreasing. 

Now that we've created this dataframe and lap time trend insight, what do we do when we want to scale it? In the next section we'll be learning how to do this by leveraging python transformations in dbt Cloud. 
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Python transfomrations in dbt Cloud 
Duration: 2

### Our first dbt python model for lap time trends
Let's get our lap time trends in our data pipeline so we have this data frame to leverage as new data comes in. The syntax of of a dbt python model is a variation of our development code in the python worksheet so we'll be explaining the code and concepts more.

1. Open your dbt Cloud browser tab. 
2. Create a new file under the **models > marts > aggregates** directory called `agg_lap_times_moving_avg.py`. 
3. Copy the following code in and **Save** the file:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    def model(dbt, session):
        # dbt configuration
        dbt.config(packages=["pandas"])

        # get upstream data
        lap_times = dbt.ref("mrt_lap_times_years").to_pandas()

        # describe the data
        lap_times["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"] = lap_times["LAP_TIME_MILLISECONDS"]/1000
        lap_time_trends = lap_times.groupby(by="RACE_YEAR")["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"].mean().to_frame()
        lap_time_trends.reset_index(inplace=True)
        lap_time_trends["LAP_MOVING_AVG_5_YEARS"] = lap_time_trends["LAP_TIME_SECONDS"].rolling(5).mean()
        lap_time_trends.columns = lap_time_trends.columns.str.upper()
        
        return lap_time_trends.round(1)
    ```
4. Let’s break down what this code is doing:
- First, we are importing the Python libraries that we are using. This is similar to a dbt *package*, but our Python libraries do *not* persist across the entire project.
- Defining a function called `model` with the parameter `dbt` and `session`. We'll define these more in depth later in this section. You can see that all the data transformation happening is within the body of the `model` function that the `return` statement is tied to.
- Then, within the context of our dbt model library, we are passing in a configuration of which packages we need using `dbt.config(packages=["pandas"])`.
- Use the `.ref()` function to retrieve the upstream data frame `mrt_lap_times_years` that we created in our last step using SQL. We cast this to a pandas dataframe (by default it's a Snowpark Dataframe).
- From there we are using python to transform our dataframe to give us a rolling average by using `rolling()` over `RACE_YEAR`. 
- Convert our Python column names to all uppercase using `.upper()`, so Snowflake recognizes them. **This has been a frequent "gotcha" for folks using dbt python so we call it out here.**
We won’t go as in depth for our subsequent scripts, but will continue to explain at a high level what new libraries, functions, and methods are doing.
5. Create the model in our warehouse by clicking **Build**.
6. We can't preview Python models directly, so let’s open a new file using the **+** button or the Control-N shortcut to create a new scratchpad:
    ```sql
    select * from {{ ref('agg_lap_times_moving_avg') }}
    ```
7. **Preview** the output. It should look the same as our snowflake python worksheet:
<img src="assets/python-transformations-dbt-cloud/preview_agg_lap_times_scratchpad.png" alt="preview_agg_lap_times_scratchpad">

8. We can see we have the same results from our python worksheet development as we have in our codified dbt python project. 

### The dbt model, .source(), .ref() and .config() functions
Let’s take a step back before starting machine learning to both review and go more in-depth at the methods that make running dbt python models possible. If you want to know more outside of this lab’s explanation read the documentation [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/python-models).

- dbt model(dbt, session). For starters, each Python model lives in a .py file in your models/ folder. It defines a function named `model()`, which takes two parameters:
    - dbt &mdash; A class compiled by dbt Core, unique to each model, enables you to run your Python code in the context of your dbt project and DAG.
    - session &mdash; A class representing your data platform’s connection to the Python backend. The session is needed to read in tables as DataFrames and to write DataFrames back to tables. In PySpark, by convention, the SparkSession is named spark, and available globally. For consistency across platforms, we always pass it into the model function as an explicit argument called session.
- The `model()` function must return a single DataFrame. On Snowpark (Snowflake), this can be a Snowpark or pandas DataFrame.
- `.source()` and `.ref()` functions. Python models participate fully in dbt's directed acyclic graph (DAG) of transformations. If you want to read directly from a raw source table, use `dbt.source()`. We saw this in our earlier section using SQL with the source function. These functions have the same execution, but with different syntax. Use the `dbt.ref()` method within a Python model to read data from other models (SQL or Python). These methods return DataFrames pointing to the upstream source, model, seed, or snapshot.
- `.config()`. Just like SQL models, there are three ways to configure Python models:
    - In a dedicated `.yml` file, within the `models/` directory
    - Within the model's `.py` file, using the `dbt.config()` method
    - Calling the `dbt.config()` method will set configurations for your model within your `.py` file, similar to the `{{ config() }} macro` in `.sql` model files. There's a limit to how complex you can get with the `dbt.config()` method. It accepts only literal values (strings, booleans, and numeric types). Passing another function or a more complex data structure is not possible. The reason is that dbt statically analyzes the arguments to `.config()` while parsing your model without executing your Python code. If you need to set a more complex configuration, we recommend you define it using the config property in a [YAML file](/reference/resource-properties/config). Learn more about configurations [here](/reference/model-configs).
        ```python 
        def model(dbt, session):

        # setting configuration
        dbt.config(materialized="table")
        ```
9. **Commit and sync** so our project contains our `agg_lap_times_moving_avg.py` model, add a commit message and **Commit changes**. 

Now that we understand how to create python transformations we can use them to prepare train machine learning models and generate predictions!

## Machine Learning: training and prediction
Duration: 8

We’re ready to start training a model to predict the driver’s position. During the ML development phase you’ll try multiple algorithms and use an evaluation method such as cross validation to determine which algorithm to use. You can definitely use dbt if you want to save and reproduce dataframes from your ML development and model selection process, but for the content of this lab we’ll have skipped ahead decided on using a logistic regression to predict position (we actually tried some other algorithms using cross validation outside of this lab such as k-nearest neighbors and a support vector classifier but that didn’t perform as well as the logistic regression and a decision tree that overfit). By doing this we won't have to make code changes between development and deployment today. 

There are 3 areas to break down as we go since we are working at the intersection all within one model file:
1. Machine Learning
2. Snowflake and Snowpark
3. dbt Python models

If you haven’t seen code like this before or use joblib files to save machine learning models, we’ll be going over them at a high level and you can explore the links for more technical in-depth along the way! Because Snowflake and dbt have abstracted away a lot of the nitty gritty about serialization and storing our model object to be called again, we won’t go into too much detail here. There’s *a lot* going on here so take it at your pace!

<!-- ------------------------ -->
### Training and saving a machine learning model

1. Project organization remains key, under the `ml` folder make a new subfolder called `training_and_prediction`.
2. Now create a new file called `train_model_to_predict_position.py` 
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/create_train_model_file.png" alt="preview-create_train_model_file-test-position">

3. Copy and save the following code (make sure copy all the way to the right):
    ```python 
    import snowflake.snowpark.functions as F
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, balanced_accuracy_score
    import io
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from joblib import dump, load
    import joblib
    import logging
    import sys
    from joblib import dump, load

    logger = logging.getLogger("mylog")

    def save_file(session, model, path, dest_filename):
        input_stream = io.BytesIO()
        joblib.dump(model, input_stream)
        session._conn.upload_stream(input_stream, path, dest_filename)
        return "successfully created file: " + path

    def model(dbt, session):
        dbt.config(
            packages = ['numpy','scikit-learn','pandas','numpy','joblib','cachetools'],
            materialized = "table",
            tags = "train"
        )
        # Create a stage in Snowflake to save our model file
        session.sql('create or replace stage MODELSTAGE').collect()
        
        #session._use_scoped_temp_objects = False
        version = "1.0"
        logger.info('Model training version: ' + version)

        # read in our training and testing upstream dataset
        test_train_df = dbt.ref("training_testing_dataset")

        #  cast snowpark df to pandas df
        test_train_pd_df = test_train_df.to_pandas()
        target_col = "POSITION_LABEL"

        # split out covariate predictors, x, from our target column position_label, y.
        split_X = test_train_pd_df.drop([target_col], axis=1)
        split_y = test_train_pd_df[target_col]

        # Split out our training and test data into proportions
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test  = train_test_split(split_X, split_y, train_size=0.7, random_state=42)
        train = [X_train, y_train]
        test = [X_test, y_test]
            # now we are only training our one model to deploy
        # we are keeping the focus on the workflows and not algorithms for this lab!
        model = LogisticRegression()
        
        # fit the preprocessing pipeline and the model together 
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)   
        y_pred = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
        predictions = [round(value) for value in y_pred]
        balanced_accuracy =  balanced_accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

        # Save the model to a stage
        save_file(session, model, "@MODELSTAGE/driver_position_"+version, "driver_position_"+version+".joblib" )
        logger.info('Model artifact:' + "@MODELSTAGE/driver_position_"+version+".joblib")
        
        # Take our pandas training and testing dataframes and put them back into snowpark dataframes
        snowpark_train_df = session.write_pandas(pd.concat(train, axis=1, join='inner'), "train_table", auto_create_table=True, create_temp_table=True)
        snowpark_test_df = session.write_pandas(pd.concat(test, axis=1, join='inner'), "test_table", auto_create_table=True, create_temp_table=True)
        
        # Union our training and testing data together and add a column indicating train vs test rows
        return  snowpark_train_df.with_column("DATASET_TYPE", F.lit("train")).union(snowpark_test_df.with_column("DATASET_TYPE", F.lit("test")))
    ```

4. Use the UI **Build** our `train_model_to_predict_position` model.
5. Breaking down our Python script:
- We’re importing some helpful libraries.
    - Defining a function called `save_file()` that takes four parameters: `session`, `model`, `path` and `dest_filename` that will save our logistic regression model file.
        - `session` &mdash; an object representing a connection to Snowflake.
        - `model` &mdash; when models are trained they are saved in memory, we will be using the model name to save our in-memory model into a joblib file to retrieve to call new predictions later.
        - `path` &mdash; a string representing the directory or bucket location where the file should be saved.
        - `dest_filename` &mdash; a string representing the desired name of the file.
    - Creating our dbt model
        - Within this model we are creating a stage called `MODELSTAGE` to place our logistic regression `joblib` model file. This is really important since we need a place to keep our model to reuse and want to ensure it's there. When using Snowpark commands, it's common to see the `.collect()` method to ensure the action is performed. Think of the session as our “start” and collect as our “end” when [working with Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/working-with-dataframes.html) (you can use other ending methods other than collect).
        - Using `.ref()` to connect into our `training_and_test_dataset` model.
        - Now we see the machine learning part of our analysis:
            - Create new dataframes for our prediction features from our target variable `position_label`.
            - Split our dataset into 70% training (and 30% testing), train_size=0.7 with a `random_state` specified to have repeatable results.
            - Specify our model is a logistic regression.
            - Fit our model. In a logistic regression this means finding the coefficients that will give the least classification error.
            - Round our predictions to the nearest integer since logistic regression creates a probability between for each class and calculate a balanced accuracy to account for imbalances in the target variable.
    - Right now our model is only in memory, so we need to use our nifty function `save_file` to save our model file to our Snowflake stage. We save our model as a joblib file so Snowpark can easily call this model object back to create predictions. We really don’t need to know much else as a data practitioner unless we want to. It’s worth noting that joblib files aren’t able to be queried directly by SQL. To do this, we would need to transform the joblib file to an SQL querable format such as JSON or CSV (out of scope for this workshop).
    - Finally we want to return our dataframe, but create a new column indicating what rows were used for training and those for training.
6. Viewing our output of this model:
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/1-preview-train-test-position.png" alt="preview-train-test-position">

7. Let’s pop back over to Snowflake. To check that our logistic regression model has been stored in our `MODELSTAGE` open a **SQL Worksheet** and use the query below to list objects in your modelstage. Make sure you are in the correct database and development schema to view your stage (this should be `PC_DBT_DB` and your dev schema - for example `dbt_hwatson`). 
    ```sql
    list @modelstage
    ```
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/2-list-snowflake-stage.png" alt="list-snowflake-stage">

8. To investigate the commands run as part of `train_model_to_predict_position.py` script, navigate to Snowflake query history to view it **Home button > Activity > Query History**. We can view the portions of query that we wrote such as `create or replace stage MODELSTAGE`, but we also see additional queries that Snowflake uses to interpret python code.
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/3-view-snowflake-query-history.png" alt="view-snowflake-query-history">

Let's use our new trained model to create predictions!

<!-- ------------------------ -->
### Predicting on new data
It's time to use that 2020 data we held out to make predictions on!

1. Create a new file under `ml/training_and_prediction` called `apply_prediction_to_position.py` and copy and save the following code:
    ```python
    import logging
    import joblib
    import pandas as pd
    import os
    from snowflake.snowpark import types as T

    DB_STAGE = 'MODELSTAGE'
    version = '1.0'
    # The name of the model file
    model_file_path = 'driver_position_'+version
    model_file_packaged = 'driver_position_'+version+'.joblib'

    # This is a local directory, used for storing the various artifacts locally
    LOCAL_TEMP_DIR = f'/tmp/driver_position'
    DOWNLOAD_DIR = os.path.join(LOCAL_TEMP_DIR, 'download')
    TARGET_MODEL_DIR_PATH = os.path.join(LOCAL_TEMP_DIR, 'ml_model')
    TARGET_LIB_PATH = os.path.join(LOCAL_TEMP_DIR, 'lib')

    # The feature columns that were used during model training
    # and that will be used during prediction
    FEATURE_COLS = [
            "RACE_YEAR"
            ,"RACE_NAME"
            ,"GRID"
            ,"CONSTRUCTOR_NAME"
            ,"DRIVER"
            ,"DRIVERS_AGE_YEARS"
            ,"DRIVER_CONFIDENCE"
            ,"CONSTRUCTOR_RELAIBLITY"
            ,"TOTAL_PIT_STOPS_PER_RACE"]

    def register_udf_for_prediction(p_predictor ,p_session ,p_dbt):

        # The prediction udf

        def predict_position(p_df: T.PandasDataFrame[int, int, int, int,
                                            int, int, int, int, int]) -> T.PandasSeries[int]:
            # Snowpark currently does not set the column name in the input dataframe
            # The default col names are like 0,1,2,... Hence we need to reset the column
            # names to the features that we initially used for training.
            p_df.columns = [*FEATURE_COLS]
            
            # Perform prediction. this returns an array object
            pred_array = p_predictor.predict(p_df)
            # Convert to series
            df_predicted = pd.Series(pred_array)
            return df_predicted

        # The list of packages that will be used by UDF
        udf_packages = p_dbt.config.get('packages')

        predict_position_udf = p_session.udf.register(
            predict_position
            ,name=f'predict_position'
            ,packages = udf_packages
        )
        return predict_position_udf

    def download_models_and_libs_from_stage(p_session):
        p_session.file.get(f'@{DB_STAGE}/{model_file_path}/{model_file_packaged}', DOWNLOAD_DIR)
    
    def load_model(p_session):
        # Load the model and initialize the predictor
        model_fl_path = os.path.join(DOWNLOAD_DIR, model_file_packaged)
        predictor = joblib.load(model_fl_path)
        return predictor
    
    # -------------------------------
    def model(dbt, session):
        dbt.config(
            packages = ['snowflake-snowpark-python' ,'scipy','scikit-learn' ,'pandas' ,'numpy'],
            materialized = "table",
            tags = "predict"
        )
        session._use_scoped_temp_objects = False
        download_models_and_libs_from_stage(session)
        predictor = load_model(session)
        predict_position_udf = register_udf_for_prediction(predictor, session ,dbt)
        
        # Retrieve the data, and perform the prediction
        hold_out_df = (dbt.ref("hold_out_dataset_for_prediction")
            .select(*FEATURE_COLS)
        )
        trained_model_file = dbt.ref("train_model_to_predict_position")

        # Perform prediction.
        new_predictions_df = hold_out_df.withColumn("position_predicted"
            ,predict_position_udf(*FEATURE_COLS)
        )
        
        return new_predictions_df
    ```
2. Use the UI Build our `apply_prediction_to_position` model.
3. **Commit and sync** our changes to keep saving our work as we go using the commit message `logistic regression model training and application` before moving on.
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/commit_training_and_prediction.png" alt="commit_training_and_prediction">
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/commit_message_training_and_prediction.png" alt="commit_message_training_and_prediction">

4. At a high level in this script, we are:
- Retrieving our staged logistic regression model
- Loading the model in
- Placing the model within a user defined function (UDF) to call in line predictions on our driver’s position
5. At a more detailed level:
- Import our libraries.
- Create variables to reference back to the `MODELSTAGE` we just created and stored our model to.
- The temporary file paths we created might look intimidating, but all we’re doing here is programmatically using an initial file path and adding to it to create the following directories:
    - LOCAL_TEMP_DIR ➡️ /tmp/driver_position
    - DOWNLOAD_DIR ➡️ /tmp/driver_position/download
    - TARGET_MODEL_DIR_PATH ➡️ /tmp/driver_position/ml_model
    - TARGET_LIB_PATH ➡️ /tmp/driver_position/lib
- Provide a list of our feature columns that we used for model training and will now be used on new data for prediction.
- Next, we are creating our main function `register_udf_for_prediction(p_predictor ,p_session ,p_dbt):`. This function is used to register a user-defined function (UDF) that performs the machine learning prediction. It takes three parameters: `p_predictor` is an instance of the machine learning model, `p_session` is an instance of the Snowflake session, and `p_dbt` is an instance of the dbt library. The function creates a UDF named `predict_position` which takes a pandas dataframe with the input features and returns a pandas series with the predictions.
- ⚠️ Pay close attention to the whitespace here. We are using a function within a function for this script.
- We have 2 simple functions that are programmatically retrieving our file paths to first get our stored model out of our `MODELSTAGE` and downloaded into the session `download_models_and_libs_from_stage` and then to load the contents of our model in (parameters) in `load_model` to use for prediction.
- Take the model we loaded in and call it `predictor` and wrap it in a UDF.
- Return our dataframe with both the features used to predict and the new label.

🧠 Another way to read this script is from the bottom up. This can help us progressively see what is going into our final dbt model and work backwards to see how the other functions are being referenced.

6. Let’s take a look at our predicted position alongside our feature variables. Open a new scratchpad and use the following query. I chose to order by the prediction of who would obtain a podium position:
    ```sql
    select * from {{ ref('apply_prediction_to_position') }} order by position_predicted
    ```
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/preview_predicted_position.png" alt="preview_predicted_position">

7. Run a fresh `dbt build` in the command bar to ensure our pipeline is working end to end. This will take a few minutes, (3 minutes and 2.4 seconds to be exact) so it's not a bad time to stretch (we know programmers slouch). This runtime is pretty performant since we're using an X-Smalll warehouse. If you want to speed up the pipeline, you can increase the [warehouse size](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-overview) (good for SQL) or use a [Snowpark-optimized Warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-snowpark-optimized) (good for Python)
<img src="assets/machine-learning-training-prediction/fresh_dbt_build_full_pipeline.png" alt="fresh_dbt_build_full_pipeline">


We can see that we created predictions in our final dataset for each result, we are ready to move on to deployment!

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Pipeline Deployment 
Duration: 5 

### Committing all development work 
Before we jump into deploying our code, let's have a quick primer on environments. Up to this point, all of the work we've done in the dbt Cloud IDE has been in our development environment, with code committed to a feature branch and the models we've built created in our development schema in Snowflake as defined in our Development environment connection. Doing this work on a feature branch, allows us to separate our code from what other coworkers are building and code that is already deemed production ready. Building models in a development schema in Snowflake allows us to separate the database objects we might still be modifying and testing from the database objects running production dashboards or other downstream dependencies. Together, the combination of a Git branch and Snowflake database objects form our environment.

Now that we've completed applying prediction, we're ready to deploy our code from our development environment to our production environment and this involves two steps:

- Promoting code from our feature branch to the production branch in our repository.
    - Generally, the production branch is going to be named your main branch and there's a review process to go through before merging code to the main branch of a repository. Here we are going to merge without review for ease of this workshop.
- Deploying code to our production environment.
    - Once our code is merged to the main branch, we'll need to run dbt in our production environment to build all of our models and run all of our tests. This will allow us to build production-ready objects into our production environment in Snowflake. Luckily for us, the Partner Connect flow has already created our deployment environment and job to facilitate this step.

1. Before getting started, let's make sure that we've committed all of our work to our feature branch. Our working branch,`snowpark-python-workshop`, should be clean. If for some reason you do still have work to commit, you'll be able to select the **Commit and sync**, provide a message, and then select **Commit changes** again.
2. Once all of your work is committed, the git workflow button will now appear as **Create pull request**. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/create_pull_request_dbt_cloud_button.png" alt="create_pull_request_dbt_cloud_button">

3. This will bring you to your GitHub repo. This will show the commits that encompass all changes made since the last pull request. Since we only added new files we are able to merge into `main` without conflicts.  Click **Create pull request**. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/review_commits_create_pull_request.png" alt="review_commits_create_pull_request">
<!-- TODO This could be updated to have only the 3 commits to be a bit cleaner. I had an extra from needing to rename a folder.  -->

4. This goes to a **Open a pull request** page. Usually, when merging in a pull request (PR) we would create descriptions and motivations for the work being completed, validation our models work (like a fresh dbt build), and note changes to exisiting models (we only created new models and didn't alter existing ones). Then typically your teammates will review, comment, and independently test out the code on your branch. dbt has created a [pull request template](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/analytics-pull-request-template) to make PRs as efficient and scalable to your analytics workflow. We'll do an abbreviated version of this for example. If you'd like you can just add a quick comment followed by **Merge pull request** since we're doing a workshop in an isolated Snowflake trial account (and won't break anything).

5. Our PR is looking good. Let's **Merge pull request**. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/merge_pr_github.png" alt="merge_pr_github">

6. Then click **Confirm merge**.

7. It's best practice to keep your repo clean by deleting your working branch once merged into main. You can always restore it later, for now **Delete Branch**. We're all done in GitHub for today!
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/delete_branch_github.png" alt="delete_branch_github">

8. Head back over to your dbt Cloud browser tab. Under **Version Control** select **Pull from "main"**. If you don't see this, refresh your browser tab and it should appear.

10. Finally, to bring our changes from our `main` branch in GitHub, select **Pull from remote**

11. Now that all of our development work has been merged to the main branch, we can build our deployment job. Given that our production environment and production job were created automatically for us through Partner Connect, all we need to do here is update some default configurations to meet our needs.
12. In the menu, select **Deploy** **> Environments**
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/deploy_environments_ui.png" alt="deploy_environments_ui">


### Setting your production schema 
1. You should see two environments listed and you'll want to select the **Deployment** environment then **Settings** to modify it.
2. Before making any changes, let's touch on what is defined within this environment. The Snowflake connection shows the credentials that dbt Cloud is using for this environment and in our case they are the same as what was created for us through Partner Connect. Our deployment job will build in our `PC_DBT_DB` database and use the default Partner Connect role and warehouse to do so. The deployment credentials section also uses the info that was created in our Partner Connect job to create the credential connection. However, it is using the same default schema that we've been using as the schema for our development environment.
3. Let's update the schema to create a new schema specifically for our production environment. Click **Edit** to allow you to modify the existing field values. Navigate to **Deployment Credentials >** **schema.**
4. Update the schema name to **production**. Remember to select **Save** after you've made the change.
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/setting-production-schema/name_production_schema.png" alt="name_production_schema">

5. By updating the schema for our production environment to **production**, it ensures that our deployment job for this environment will build our dbt models in the **production** schema within the `PC_DBT_DB` database as defined in the Snowflake Connection section.

### Creating multiple jobs 
In machine learning you rarely want to retrain your model as often as you want new predictions. Model training is compute intensive and requires person time for development and evaluation, while new predictions can run through an exisiting model to gain insights about drivers, customers, events, etc. This problem can be trikcy, but dbt Cloud makes it easy by: automatically creating dependencies from your code and making setup for environments and jobs simple.

With this in mind we're going to have two jobs:
- One job that initially builds or retrains our machine learning model. This job will run all the models in our project, and was already created through partner connect. 
- Another job that focuses on creating predictions from the existing machine learning model. This job will exclude exclude running `apply_prediction_to_position.py`, and we will need to create this job.


1. Let's look at over to our production job created by partner connect. Click on the deploy tab again and then select **Jobs**. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/deploy_jobs_ui.png" alt="deploy_jobs_ui"> You should see an existing and preconfigured **Partner Connect Trial Job**. <img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/pc_default_job.png" alt="pc_default_job"> 

2. Similar to the environment, click on the job, then select **Settings** to modify it. Let's take a look at the job to understand it before making changes.
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/pc_job_settings.png" alt="pc_job_settings"> 

- The Environment section is what connects this job with the environment we want it to run in. This job is already defaulted to use the Deployment environment that we just updated and the rest of the settings we can keep as is. 
- The Execution settings section gives us the option to generate docs, run source freshness, and defer to a previous run state. For the purposes of our lab, we're going to keep these settings as is as well and stick with just generating docs.
- The Commands section is where we specify exactly which commands we want to run during this job. The command `dbt build` will run and test all the models our in project. We'll keep this as is.
- Finally, we have the Triggers section, where we have a number of different options for scheduling our job. Given that our data isn't updating regularly here and we're running this job manually for now, we're also going to leave this section alone. 
  
3. So, what are we changing then? The job name and commands!
- Click **Edit** to allow you to make changes. Then update the name of the job to **Machine learning initial model build or retraining** this may seem like a mouthful, but naming with an entire data team is helpful (or our future selves after not looking at a project for 3 months). 
- Go to **Execution Settings > Commands**. Click **Add Command** and input `dbt build`.
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/edit_pc_job.png" alt="edit_pc_job"> 

- Delete the existing commands `dbt seed`, `dbt run`, and `dbt test`. Together they make up the functions of `dbt build` so we are simplifying our code. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/edit_commands.png" alt="edit_commands"> 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/delete_commands.png" alt="delete_commands"> 

- After that's done, DON'T FORGET CLICK **Save**.
4. Now let's go to run our job. Clicking on the job name in the path at the top of the screen will take you back to the job run history page where you'll be able to click **Run** to kick off the job. In total we produced 106 entities: 14 view models, 67 tests, 24 table models, 1 incremental model. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/run_job.png" alt="run_job"> 

5. Let's go over to Snowflake to confirm that everything built as expected in our production schema. Refresh the database objects in your Snowflake account and you should see the production schema now within our default Partner Connect database. If you click into the schema and everything ran successfully, you should be able to see all of the models we developed. 
<img src="assets/pipeline-deployment/creating-multiple-jobs/job_run_output.png" alt="job_run_output"> 

6. Go back to dbt Cloud and navigate to **Deploy > Jobs > Create Job**. Edit the following job settings:
- Set the **General Settings > Job Name** to **Prediction on data with existing model**
- Set the **Execution Settings > Commands** to `dbt build --exclude apply_prediction_to_position`
- We can keep all other job settings the same 
- **Save** your job settings 
7. Run your job using **Run Now**. Remember the only difference between our first job and this job is we are excluding model retraining. So we will have one less model in our outputs. We can confirm this in our run steps.
8. Open the job and go to **Run Steps > Invoke**. In our job details we can confirm one less entity (105 instead of 106). 

That wraps all of our hands on the keyboard time for today!
