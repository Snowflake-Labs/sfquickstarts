# Building Dynamic Tables in Snowflake with Coalesce
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview  
Duration: 2

Dynamic tables are a new table type offered by Snowflake that allow data teams to use SQL statements to declaratively define the results of data pipelines. Dynamic tables simplify the process of creating and managing data pipelines by streamlining data transformations without having to manage Streams and Tasks.

[Dynamic tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) materialize the results of a query that you specify. Instead of creating a separate target table and writing code to transform and update the data in that table, you can define the target table as a dynamic table and specify the SQL statement that performs the transformation. An automated process updates the materialized results automatically through regular [refreshes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh). These automatic refreshes occur based on changes to your data, meaning that they only operate on new data changes since the last refresh.

### Using Coalesce to Build Dynamic Tables

As the only transformation solution uniquely built for Snowflake, Coalesce offers a way to visually build, adjust and deploy dynamic tables in Snowflake orders of magnitude faster without having to code by hand. Coalesce provides many “out-of-the-box” node types that are ready to use immediately upon logging into the platform, in addition to empowering users to create their own nodes [known as user-defined nodes, or UDNs](https://docs.coalesce.io/docs/user-defined-nodes). The dynamic table node that you will use in the following exercise is a form of a UDN found in Coalesce. 

In this guide, you will build a small directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Coalesce using dynamic table nodes that understands dependency ordering. Snowflake handles the refreshing of the pipeline, while Coalesce guarantees that dynamic tables are created only after all upstream dependencies are satisfied. When building pipelines without dynamic tables, Coalesce uses the dependency graph for deployment and refreshing of tables and views. 

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Snowflake
- Basic knowledge of SQL, database concepts, and objects
- Optional completion of the foundational Coalesce Quickstart [Accelerating Transformations with Coalesce and Snowflake](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/transform_your_data_with_coalesce/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

### What You’ll Need 
- A Snowflake account [trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_) or access to an existing account with `ACCOUNT ADMIN` privileges

### What You’ll Learn 
- How to create dynamic tables for Snowflake ELT processing, faster and easier than ever before
- How to deploy dynamic tables to non-development environments 

### What You’ll Build 
- Analytics-ready dynamic tables
- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) made up of dynamic table nodes

<!-- -------------------------->
## Before You Start
Duration: 10 

Complete the steps in this section to prepare your Coalesce environment. Please note that these steps assume you are using trial Snowflake and Coalesce accounts. If you are using pre-existing accounts, you will need to adjust your [Storage Locations and Mappings](https://docs.coalesce.io/docs/storage-locations) to use the sample Snowflake dataset as shown in this guide. 

### Step 1: Set Up Your Snowflake Trial Account

1. Fill out the Snowflake trial account form [here](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_). Use an email address that is not associated with an existing Snowflake account. 

2. When signing up for your Snowflake account, select the region that is physically closest to you and choose Enterprise as your Snowflake edition. Please note that the Snowflake edition, cloud provider, and region used when following this guide do not matter. 

After registering, you will receive an email from Snowflake with an activation link and URL for accessing your trial account. Finish setting up your account following the instructions in the email.

7. Coalesce provides a marketplace of certified nodes for different use cases and transformations. These nodes are made available in the form of a package that can be directly installed into your workspace and are immediately available to use. One of these packages is the Dynamic Tables package. 

Open the Build Settings of your workspace, and navigate to Packages. Click the Browse button in the upper right hand corner. This will take you to the Coalesce Marketplace. Find the Dynamic Tables package and click **Find out more**. Copy the Package ID from the package details page and navigate back to Coalesce. 

![packagespage](assets/2.13_packages_workspace.png)

Click the Install button on the packages page and paste in the Package ID. The most recent version of the package will be automatically selected. Give the package an Alias - this is the name of the package as it will appear in the build interface of Coalesce. 

![installpackage](assets/2.17_install_package.png)

8. Once the dynamic tables node is loaded into your account, navigate to back to your Snowflake account and create a new Worksheet named **Dynamic Tables.** 

Copy and run this [code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMSSVw3uwpFo2KM_GI7teSD9x2GMQL_FkUJdtjd8-cw/edit?usp=sharing) in your Worksheet. This will create a standalone Development, QA (Testing) and Production environment for you. 

![sfscript](assets/2.14_sf_script.png)

9. Return to your Coalesce account, click on the pencil icon next to the name of your Workspace and then click on **Storage Mappings.** For your `SRC` mapping, select your newly created `DEV` database (starting with your first initial and last name) and `SOURCE DATA` schema. For your `WORK` mapping, select your `DEV` database and `REPORTING` schema as shown below.

![storagemappings](assets/2.15_storage_mappings.png)

10. Click on **Parameters** in your Workspace Settings and enter the following parameter in the field. This parameter will set the warehouse that will be used in your development Environment.

## Creating Dynamic Table Nodes

Duration: 5

1. Select your `CUSTOMER`, `NATION` and `REGION` source nodes. Then right click and hover over **Join Nodes** and select **Dynamic Table Stage**. 

![joinnodes](assets/4.1_join_nodes.png)

2. Your new dynamic table node will open to show a handful of configuration settings in the right sidebar. These include **Node Properties** which includes your Storage Location, node type and whether deployment is enabled for your node. 

Under **Dynamic Table Options,** you have the option of changing the selected warehouse that you would like to use to run your node. Enter the warehouse `dev_wh_xs` that was created when you ran your setup code in Snowflake. In Coalesce, you have the ability to change and set specific warehouses that run each dynamic table node in a given environment (e.g. `DEV`, `QA`, or `PROD`) by using [Parameters](https://docs.coalesce.io/docs/rtp-default).


The **Downstream** toggle controls whether refreshes are determined by subsequent nodes in your pipeline. 

Your **Lag Specification** determines how often your node is refreshed. Set this schedule to 1 minute as shown. 

![dtnodeconfig](assets/4.2_dt_node_config.png)

3. Switch over to the **Join** tab in your dynamic table node and complete the join using the following statement: 

```sql
FROM {{ ref('SRC', 'NATION') }} "NATION"
INNER JOIN {{ ref('SRC', 'REGION') }} "REGION"
ON "NATION"."N_REGIONKEY" = "REGION"."R_REGIONKEY"
INNER JOIN {{ ref('SRC', 'CUSTOMER') }} "CUSTOMER"
ON "NATION"."N_NATIONKEY" = "CUSTOMER"."C_NATIONKEY"
```

![jointab](assets/4.3_dt_join_tab.png)

4. Press the Command key to multi-select and delete the columns `N_NATIONKEY`, `N_REGIONKEY`, `N_COMMENT`, `R_REGIONKEY` and `R_COMMENT` in your node. 

![deletecolumns](assets/4.4_delete_columns.png)

5. Click the **Create** button to create your dynamic table node. You can expand the DDL statement and view the code that was auto-generated by Coalesce to create the node.

ON "DT_ORDERS_LINEITEM"."O_CUSTKEY" = "DT_CUSTOMER_NATION_REGION"."C_CUSTKEY"
```

![thirdjoinstatment](assets/5.2_third_join_statement.png)

3. Return to the **Mapping** grid, press the Shift key and select the `C_ADDRESS`, `C_NATIONKEY`, `C_PHONE`, `C_ACCTBAL`, `C_MKTSEGMENT`, and `C_COMMENT` columns. Right click and select **Delete Columns** from the dropdown menu. 

![deletebulkcolumns](assets/5.3_delete_bulk_columns.png)

4. Select the `C_CUSTKEY` column. Press and hold the Shift and Option buttons, then scroll upwards to multi-select every column from `C_CUSTKEY` to `L_EXTENDEDPRICE`. Right click on the columns and select **Delete Columns** to bulk delete them. Finally, delete all of the remaining columns but `C_NAME` and `L_QUANTITY`. 

![deletecolumns](assets/5.4_delete_columns.png)

5. Select the `C_NAME` column and drag it to the top of your **Mapping** grid so that it appears in front of the `L_QUANTITY` column. Select `L_QUANTITY` and add the aggregation below to the **Transform** field: 

```sql
sum({{SRC}})
```

![aggregation](assets/5.5_aggregration.png)

6. In your Config panel to the right, click on **General Options.** Select **Group By All** and toggle this on to utilize Snowflake’s `GROUP BY ALL` capability. 

![groupbyall](assets/5.6_groupbyall.png)

7. Under **Dynamic Table Options**, ensure that your node will be refreshed slightly less frequently than your previous dynamic table nodes by setting your **Time Value** to 5 minutes. 

![lagtime](assets/5.7_lagtime.png)

8. Press the **Create** button to create your dynamic tables node, and then expand your Create statement to view the `GROUP BY ALL` function that you added via the Config. 

![createdtnode3](assets/5.8_create_dt_node_3.png)

Congratulations! You have built out a small DAG of dynamic table nodes. 

<!---------------------------->
## Running and Visualizing Your DAG
Duration: 5 

1. To run your nodes as a DAG in its entirety, select your preceding node `DT_ORDERS_LINEITEM` to open it. In the Config section, select the **Downstream** option and press the **Create** button. 

![downstream](assets/6.1_downstream1.png)

2. Return to your Build interface, open up your `DT_CUSTOMER_NATION_REGION` node and repeat this action by selecting the **Downstream** option and creating your node. 

![downstream2](assets/6.2_downstream2.png)

3. Return to your Build interface and click the **Run All** button in the upper right corner to run your DAG. Now you are no longer using a lag to refresh the preceding dynamic table nodes. Instead, these dynamic tables will refresh based on the lag time of your subsequent `DT_ORDERS_LINEITEM_CUSTOMER_NATION_REGION` node.
