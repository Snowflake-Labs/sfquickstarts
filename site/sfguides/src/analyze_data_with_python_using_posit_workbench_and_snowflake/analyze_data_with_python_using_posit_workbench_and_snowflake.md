#  Analyze Data with Python using Posit Workbench and Snowflake

## Overview
Duration: 1

In this guide, we'll use Python to analyze data in Snowflake using the Posit
Workbench Native App. You'll learn how to launch the Posit Workbench Native App and use the available VS Code IDE. You'll also learn how to use the Ibis library to translate Python code into SQL, allowing you to run data operations directly in Snowflake's high-performance computing environment.

We'll focus on a healthcare example by analyzing heart failure data. We'll guide you through accessing the data and performing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Finally, you'll see how to generate an HTML report, build an interactive Shiny app, and write data back to Snowflake—completing an end-to-end analysis in Python _entirely within Snowflake_.

### What You Will Learn

- How to work in VS Code from Posit Workbench Native App.
- How to connect to your Snowflake data from Python to create tables, visualizations, and more.

### What You Will Build

- A VS Code environment to use within Snowflake.
- A Quarto document that contains plots and tables built with Python, using data stored in Snowflake.
- An interactive Shiny for Python application built using data stored in Snowflake.

Along the way, you will use Python to analyze which variables are associated with survival among patients with heart failure.
You can follow along with this quickstart guide,
or look at the materials provided in the accompanying repository:
<https://github.com/posit-dev/snowflake-posit-quickstart-python>.

### Prerequisites

- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/) with appropriate access to databases and schemas.
- A Posit Workbench license and the ability to launch Posit Workbench from [Snowflake Native Applications](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/integration/snowflake/native-app/). This can be provided by an administrator with the `accountadmin` role.
- Familiarity with Python.


## Setup
Duration: 15

Before we begin, let’s set up a few components. We need to:

- Add the heart failure data to Snowflake
- Launch the Posit Workbench Native App
- Create a VS Code session
- Create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries

### Create a warehouse, database, and schema

For this analysis, we'll use the [Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records) dataset. First, we need to create a warehouse, database, and schema.

In Snowsight, open a SQL worksheet (`Create` > `SQL Worksheet`). Then, paste in and run the following code, which creates the necessary database, schema, and warehouse. **Make sure to change the role to your own role.**

```sql
USE ROLE myrole; -- Replace with your actual Snowflake role (e.g., sysadmin)

CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE HEART_FAILURE;

CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE HF_WH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'xsmall'
    WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'standard'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
```

This creates a database named `HEART_FAILURE` with a schema `PUBLIC`, as well as a warehouse named `HF_WH`.

### Load data into Snowflake

Next, we need to create a table to hold the heart failure dataset.

1. **Download the dataset from UCI:**
   [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records)

2. **Unzip the downloaded file.** You should now see a file named `heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`. We’ll upload this CSV into Snowflake using the Snowsight UI.

3. In **Snowsight**, click `Create > Add Data`, then select `Load Data into a Table`.

4. Click `Browse` and choose `heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`.

5. Under **Select or create a database and schema**, choose:
   - **Database:** `HEART_FAILURE`
   - **Schema:** `PUBLIC`

6. Under **Select or create a table**:
   - Ensure **+ Create new table** is selected.
   - For **Name**, enter `HEART_FAILURE`.

7. Click `Next`, then `Load`.

### Confirm the database, data, and schema

You should now be able to see the heart failure data in Snowsight. Navigate to `Data` > `Databases` > `HEART_FAILURE` > `PUBLIC` > `Tables`. You should now see the `HEART_FAILURE` table.

![](assets/snowflake/04-confirm_data.png)

### Launch Posit Workbench

We can now start exploring the data using Posit Workbench.
You can find Posit Workbench as a Snowflake Native Application
and use it to connect to your database.

#### Step 1: Navigate to Apps

In your Snowflake account, go to `Data Products` > `Apps` to open the Native Apps collection. If Posit Workbench is not already installed, click `Get`. Please note that the Native App must be [installed and configured ](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/integration/snowflake/native-app/install.html) by an administrator.

![](assets/snowflake/05-get_posit_workbench.png)

#### Step 2: Open the Posit Workbench Native App

Once Posit Workbench is installed, click on the app under `Installed Apps` to launch the app. If you do not see the Posit Workbench app listed, ask your Snowflake account administrator for access to the app.

![](assets/snowflake/06-open_app.png)

After clicking on the app, you will see a page with configuration instructions and a blue `Launch app` button.

![](assets/snowflake/09-launch-app.png)

Click on `Launch app`. This should take you to the webpage generated for the Workbench application. You may be prompted to first login to Snowflake using your regular credentials or authentication method.

### Create a VS Code Session

Posit Workbench provides several IDEs, including VS Code, RStudio Pro, and JupyterLab. For this analysis, we will use VS Code.

#### Step 1: New Session

Within Posit Workbench, click `New Session` to launch a new session.

<img src="assets/posit_workbench/01-start_new_session.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" />

#### Step 2: Select an IDE

When prompted, select VS Code.

<img src="assets/posit_workbench/02-create_new_session_snowflake.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" />

#### Step 3: Log into your Snowflake account

Next, connect to your Snowflake account from within Posit Workbench.
Under `Session Credentials`, click the button with the Snowflake icon to sign in to Snowflake.
Follow the sign in prompts.

<img src="assets/posit_workbench/03-snowflake_login.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" />

When you're successfully signed in to Snowflake, the Snowflake button will turn blue
and there will be a check mark in the upper-left corner.

<img src="assets/posit_workbench/04-snowflake_login_success.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" />


#### Step 4: Launch VS Code

Click `Start Session` to launch VS Code.

You will now be able to work with your Snowflake data
in VS Code. Since the IDE is provided by the Posit Workbench Native App,
your entire analysis will occur securely within Snowflake.

## Build Report and Dashboard
Duration: 2

Before we dive into the specifics of the code, let's first discuss Quarto. We've written our analysis in a Quarto (`.qmd`) document, [quarto.qmd](https://github.com/posit-dev/snowflake-posit-quickstart-python/blob/main/quarto.qmd). [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
is an open-source publishing system that makes it easy to create
[data products](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) such as
[documents](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html),
[presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/),
[dashboards](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/),
[websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/),
and
[books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

By placing our work in a Quarto document, we've interwoven all of our code, results, output, and prose text into a single literate programming document.
This way everything can travel together in a reproducible data product.

A Quarto document can be thought of as a regular markdown document,
but with the ability to run code chunks.

You can run any of the code chunks by clicking the `Run Cell` button above the chunk
in VS Code.

<img src="assets/quarto/run-chunk.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" />

When you run a cell, cell output is displayed in the Jupyter interactive console.

![](assets/quarto/interactive-console.png)

To render and preview the entire document, click the `Preview` button
or run `quarto preview quarto.qmd` from the terminal.

![](assets/quarto/preview.png)

This will run all the code in the document from top to bottom and
generate an HTML file, by default, for you to view and share.

### Learn More about Quarto

You can learn more about Quarto here: <https://quarto.org/>,
and the documentation for all the various Quarto outputs here: <https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>.
Quarto works with Python, R, and Javascript Observable code out-of-the box,
and is a great tool to communicate your data science analyses.

## Access Snowflake Data
Duration: 5

Now, let's take a closer look at the code in our Quarto document. Our code will run
in our Python environment, but will use data stored in our database on Snowflake.

To access this data, we'll use the Ibis library to connect to the database and
query the data from Python, without having to write raw SQL.
Let's take a look at how this works.

### Connect to Database

[Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) is an open source dataframe library that works with a wide variety of backends,
including Snowflake.

First, we import `ibis`, then use `ibis.snowflake.connect` to connect to the Snowflake
database. We need to provide a `warehouse` for compute and a `database` to connect to.
We can also provide a `schema` here to make connecting to specific tables easier.

```python
import ibis

con = ibis.snowflake.connect(
  warehouse="HF_WH",
  database="HEART_FAILURE",
  schema="PUBLIC",
  connection_name="workbench"
)
```

The variable `con` now stores our connection.

### Create a table

Once we build a connection, we can use `table()` to create an Ibis [table expression](https://ibis-project.org/reference/expression-tables#:~:text=A%20table%20expression%20contains%20an,new%20Table%20with%20those%20changes) that represents the database table.

```python
heart_failure = con.table("HEART_FAILURE")
```

### Translate Python to SQL

We can now use Ibis to interact with `heart_failure`. For example,
we can filter rows and rename and select columns.

```python
heart_failure_filtered = (
    heart_failure.filter(heart_failure.AGE < 50)
    .rename(
        {
            "age": "AGE",
            "diabetes": "DIABETES",
            "serum_sodium": "SERUM_SODIUM",
            "serum_creatinine": "SERUM_CREATININE",
            "sex": "SEX",
            "death_event": "DEATH_EVENT",
        }
    )
    .select(
        ["age", "diabetes", "serum_sodium", "serum_creatinine", "sex", "death_event"]
    )
)
```

Right now, `heart_failure_filtered` is still a [table expression](https://ibis-project.org/reference/expression-tables).
Ibis lazily evaluates commands, which means that the full query is never run on
the database unless explicitly requested.

Use `.execute()` or `.to_pandas()` to force Ibis to compile the table expression
into SQL and run that SQL on Snowflake.

```python
heart_failure_filtered.execute()
```

If we want to see the SQL code that Ibis generates, we can run `ibis.to_sql()`.

```python
ibis.to_sql(heart_failure_filtered)
```

```
SELECT
  "t0"."AGE" AS "age",
  "t0"."DIABETES" AS "diabetes",
  "t0"."SERUM_SODIUM" AS "serum_sodium",
  "t0"."SERUM_CREATININE" AS "serum_creatinine",
  "t0"."SEX" AS "sex",
  "t0"."DEATH_EVENT" AS "death_event"
FROM "HEART_FAILURE" AS "t0"
WHERE
  "t0"."AGE" < 50
```

### Summary

This system:

1. Keeps our data in the database, saving memory in the Python session.
2. Pushes computations to the database, saving compute in the Python session.
3. Evaluates queries lazily, saving compute in the database.

We don't need to manage the process, it happens automatically behind the scenes.

You can learn more about Ibis [here](https://ibis-project.org/). Take a look at the
[Snowflake backend documentation](https://ibis-project.org/backends/snowflake) to
learn more about using Ibis to interact with
Snowflake specifically.

## Write Snowflake Data
Duration: 1

You can also use Ibis to create a new table in a database or append to an existing table.

To add a new table, use `create_table()`.

```python
con.create_table("HEART_FAILURE_FILTERED", heart_failure_filtered)
```

To insert data into an existing table, use [`insert()`](https://ibis-project.org/backends/snowflake#ibis.backends.snowflake.Backend.insert).

Now that we understand how to interact with our database, we can use Python to perform our analysis.

## Clean Data
Duration: 5

We want to understand which variables in `HEART_FAILURE` are associated with survival
of patients with heart failure.

First, we convert the column names to lowercase so we won't need to worry about capitalization.

```python
heart_failure = heart_failure.rename(
    {
        "age": "AGE",
        "diabetes": "DIABETES",
        "serum_sodium": "SERUM_SODIUM",
        "serum_creatinine": "SERUM_CREATININE",
        "sex": "SEX",
        "death_event": "DEATH_EVENT",
    }
)
```


### Filter ages

For now, we'll focus on patients younger than 50. We also reduce the data to just the columns we're interested in.

```python
heart_failure_filtered = (
    heart_failure
    .filter(heart_failure.age < 50)  # Filter to age < 50
    .select(["age", "diabetes", "serum_sodium", "serum_creatinine", "sex", "death_event"])
)
```

> aside positive
>
> By default, Ibis is in _deferred mode_ and lazily evaluates table expressions. To more easily interact with your tables and see the results of your code, you can turn on _interactive code_. In [interactive mode](https://ibis-project.org/how-to/configure/basics#interactive-mode), expressions are executed when printed to the console. Turn on interactive mode with `ibis.options.interactive = True`.

## Visualize Data
Duration: 5

The heart failure data provides important insights that can help us:

- Identify factors associated with increased risk of mortality after heart failure.
- Predict future survival outcomes based on historical clinical data.
- Benchmark patient outcomes based on clinical indicators like serum sodium levels.

Visualizing clinical variables across different patient groups can help identify patterns.

### Visualize serum sodium levels

We can use [plotnine](https://plotnine.org/) to visually compare sodium levels across different patient groups. In this plot, we see the distribution of serum sodium based on whether the patients have diabetes and whether they survived (`0`) or died (`1`) during the follow-up period.

```python
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_boxplot, labs, theme

heart_failure_plot = (
    heart_failure_filtered
    .mutate(
        death_event=heart_failure_filtered["death_event"].cast("string"),
        diabetes=heart_failure_filtered["diabetes"].cast("string")
    )
)

(
    ggplot(heart_failure_plot, aes(x="death_event", y="serum_sodium", color="diabetes")) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(
        title="Serum Sodium Levels by Diabetes Status and Survival Outcome",
        x="Survival Outcome (0 = Survived, 1 = Died)",
        y="Serum Sodium (mEq/L)",
        color="Diabetes"
    ) +
    theme(legend_position="bottom")
)
```

![](assets/analysis/plot-sodium.png)

## Create tables for Analysis
Duration: 5

Next, we'll use Ibis to calculate the median values for various clinical metrics across different patient groups.

```python
(
    heart_failure_filtered
    .group_by(["death_event", "diabetes"])
    .aggregate(
        median_age=heart_failure_filtered["age"].median(),
        median_serum_creatinine=heart_failure_filtered["serum_creatinine"].median(),
        median_serum_sodium=heart_failure_filtered["serum_sodium"].median()
    )
)
```

This is a useful way to examine the information for ourselves. However, if we wish to share the information with others, we might prefer to present the table in a more polished format. We can do this with the [Great Tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) package.

The following code prepares a table named `comparison`, which we'll display with Great Tables.

```python
comparison = (
    heart_failure_filtered
    .group_by(["death_event", "diabetes"])
    .aggregate(
        median_age=heart_failure_filtered["age"].median(),
        median_serum_creatinine=heart_failure_filtered["serum_creatinine"].median(),
        median_serum_sodium=heart_failure_filtered["serum_sodium"].median()
    )
    .mutate(
        death_event=ibis.ifelse(heart_failure_filtered["death_event"] == 1, "Died", "Survived"),
        diabetes=ibis.ifelse(heart_failure_filtered["diabetes"] == 1, "Yes", "No"),
        median_serum_creatinine=heart_failure_filtered["serum_creatinine"].median().cast("float64")
    )
    .rename(
        {
            "Survival Outcome": "death_event",
            "Diabetes Status": "diabetes",
            "Median Age": "median_age",
            "Median Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)": "median_serum_creatinine",
            "Median Serum Sodium (mEq/L)": "median_serum_sodium"
        }
    )
)
```

Next, we use `GT()` and other Great Tables functions to create and style a table that displays `comparison`. Note that we need to evaluate `comparison` with `.execute()` first because `GT()` only accepts Pandas or Polars DataFrames.

```python
from great_tables import GT

(
    GT(comparison.execute())
    .tab_header(title="Clinical Metrics by Survival Outcome and Diabetes Status")
    .fmt_number(
        columns=["Median Age", "Median Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)", "Median Serum Sodium (mEq/L)"],
        decimals=1
    )
    .data_color(
        columns=["Median Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)", "Median Serum Sodium (mEq/L)"],
        palette=["white", "blue"]
    )
)
```

## Create Shiny Application
Duration: 2

Earlier, we showed you how to render a report from our Quarto document. Another way
to share our work and allow others to explore the heart failure dataset is to create an
interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app.

Our GitHub repository contains an [example Shiny app](https://github.com/posit-dev/snowflake-posit-quickstart-python/tree/main/app).
This app allows the user
to explore different clinical metrics in one place.

![](assets/shiny/shiny.png)

To run the app, open `app/app.py` and then click the `Run Shiny App` button at the
top of the script in VS Code.

![](assets/shiny/run.png)

After launching the app, use the sidebar to change the metric displayed.
