## Connect Snowflake to Improvado
Duration: 4

In this step, we’ll learn how to connect your Snowflake schema to Improvado. Improvado integrates with Snowflake using a native Python Connector, ensuring efficient data transfers and fast updates.

### Connecting a Data source
Connecting a Data source in Improvado enables you to extract data and then load it into your analytics and reporting frameworks. Improvado offers 500+ integrations with Marketing, eCommerce, CRM, Flat Data, SEO & SEM, and many other providers.

![DataSources](assets/data_sources.png) 


Follow these simple steps to connect a data source:
Go to the Data sources page and select a necessary Data source to extract your data
Enter required credentials or authorize using OAuth (depending on Data source API capabilities)
Then, you’ll be redirected to the Connection Details page, where you can set up data extraction.
### Step 1. Database permissions
Now you’ll need to grant the following permissions to your Snowflake database schema:
- `CREATE`
- `ALTER TABLE`
- `DELETE`
- `INSERT`

### Step 2. Select a destination
Log in to the Improvado platform and navigate to the Destinations page from the left-hand side menu. This page is a catalog of all the available destinations for data loading.

Click on the **Snowflake** tile.

### Step 3. Complete configuration
On the Snowflake connection page, fill in the following fields:
1. Enter a name for your Destination connection in the **Title**.
2. Enter the **Account**.
3. Enter the **User Name**.
4. Enter the **Password**.
5. Enter the **Database Name**.
6. Enter the **Warehouse**.
7. Specify the **Schema** of your database.
8. Enter the **Role**.
   - The `SYSADMIN` role should be granted to the specified user. Make sure you’re using a non-public role because it doesn’t have enough permissions for the load process.
9. Select the necessary **Use static IP** option from the dropdown.

### AI Agent and your Snowflake data
After successfully connecting your Snowflake database, Improvado AI Agent will automatically analyze data in your Snowflake storage and generate metadata for accurate analytics reports and consistent Marketing Data Governance workflows.
### How to access your data using Snowsight
