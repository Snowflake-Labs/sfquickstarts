4. Select the **Snowflake** connector, and then click **Select**.

    ![datastage_snowflake_26](assets/datastage_snowflake_26.png)<br><br>

5. On the *Create* connection: *Snowflake* page, type **Snowflake** for the connection name.<br><br>
6. For the *Connection details*, complete the following fields using the information from the Snowflake account you created in the first task:
    - Account name: Your account name is a combination of your account ID, your region, and your cloud provider. You can find this information in the URL when logged in to your Snowflake account. For example, if your login URL is https://app.snowflake.com/us-east4.gcp/iu68134, then your account name is iu68134.us-east4.gcp.
    - Database: Type **DATASTAGEDB**.
    - Role: Type **ACCOUNTADMIN**.
    - Warehouse: Type **DATASTAGEDATA**.
    - Username: Type your Snowflake account username.
    - Password: Type your Snowflake account password.
    - Click **Test Connection** to test the connection to your Snowflake account.<br><br>
7. If the test is successful, click **Create**. This will create the Snowflake connector which you can use to load the data from Db2 Warehouse into your Snowflake account. <br><br>

**Check your progress**: The following image shows the new connection information. You are now ready to create the DataStage flow.

![datastage_snowflake_27](assets/datastage_snowflake_27.png)<br><br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create a DataStage flow
Duration: 1

Now you are ready to create a DataStage flow that loads the Db2 Warehouse data to your Snowflake data warehouse. Follow these steps to create the DataStage flow:

1. From the *Assets* tab, click **New Asset**. 

    ![datastage_snowflake_28](assets/datastage_snowflake_28.png)<br><br>

2. In the *Graphical builders* section, click **DataStage**. 

    ![datastage_snowflake_29](assets/datastage_snowflake_29.png)<br><br>

3. For the *Name*, type **Load Db2 data to Snowflake**.

    ![datastage_snowflake_30](assets/datastage_snowflake_30.png)<br><br>

4. Click **Create**. The DataStage canvas displays where you can create the flow to load data onto Snowflake.<br><br>

**Check your progress**: The following image shows an empty DataStage canvas. You are now ready to design a DataStage flow.

![datastage_snowflake_31](assets/datastage_snowflake_31.png)<br><br>
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Design the DataStage flow
Duration: 5

Now you are ready to design a DataStage flow to load data into Snowflake. The DataStage flow contains two connector nodes: the Db2 Warehouse connector pointing to the source data asset and the Snowflake connector pointing to the target data asset. You will also add in two other nodes to perform simple transformations and join and filter the data assets. Follow these steps to add the nodes to your canvas:<br>

**Add the two connector nodes**: 

1. In the node palette, expand the **Connectors** section.

    ![datastage_snowflake_34](assets/datastage_snowflake_34.png)
    ![datastage_snowflake_35](assets/datastage_snowflake_35.png)<br><br>

2. Drag the **Asset browser** connector and drop it anywhere on the empty canvas.

    ![datastage_snowflake_36](assets/datastage_snowflake_36.png)<br><br>

3. When you drop the *Asset Browser connector* on the canvas, you are prompted to select the asset.
    - To locate the asset, select **Connection > Data Fabric Trial - Db2 Warehouse > BANKING > MORTGAGE_APPLICATION**. 
    **Note**: To expand the connection and schema, click the connection or schema name instead of the checkbox.<br>
        ![datastage_snowflake_37](assets/datastage_snowflake_37.png)<br>

    - Click **Add** to drop the Db2 data source onto the DataStage canvas.

        ![datastage_snowflake_38](assets/datastage_snowflake_38.png)
        ![datastage_snowflake_39](assets/datastage_snowflake_39.png)<br><br>

4. Double-click the **MORTGAGE_APPLICATION** node to see its settings.
    - Click the **Output** tab.
    - Check the **Runtime column propagation** option. DataStage is flexible about metadata. It can handle where metadata is not fully defined. In this case, we select **Runtime column propagation** so that if the DataStage job encounters extra columns that are not defined in the metadata when it actually runs, it adopts these extra columns and propagates them through the rest of the job. This feature allows your flow design to be flexible for schema drift. 
    - Click **Save**. 

        ![datastage_snowflake_40](assets/datastage_snowflake_40.png)

Because you are reading data from Db2 Warehouse into Snowflake, the Db2 connector is positioned first in the flow. Your goal is to load the Db2 Warehouse data into Snowflake. Next, you will add a Snowflake connector that reads the data from the Db2 Warehouse connector. Thus, the Snowflake connector is positioned second in the flow.<br>

5. Back in the **Node palette**, expand the **Connectors** section.
6. Drag the **Asset browser** connector and drop it on the canvas so it is positioned as the second node.
    - To locate the schema, select **Connection > Snowflake > MORTGAGE. Note:** Click the checkbox to select the *MORTGAGE* schema name.
    - Click **Add** to drop the Snowflake connection onto the DataStage canvas.

        ![datastage_snowflake_41](assets/datastage_snowflake_41.png)<br><br>

7. To link the nodes together, hover over the **Mortgage_Application_1** node until you see an arrow. Drag the arrow to the Snowflake connection to connect the two nodes.

    ![datastage_snowflake_42](assets/datastage_snowflake_42.png)<br><br>

8. Double-click the **MORTGAGE_1** connector to see its settings.
    - Change the node name to **Snowflake_mortgage_data**. 

        ![datastage_snowflake_43](assets/datastage_snowflake_43.png)<br>

    - In the settings side panel, click the **Input** tab.
    - Expand the **Usage** section. 
    - For *Write mode*, select **Insert**. 
    - For the *Table name*, add **APPLICATION** after the schema name, so the full table name reads ***MORTGAGE.APPLICATION***.
    - For the *Table action*, select **Replace**. This setting will create the table in the specified database and schema in Snowflake, and then load the enterprise data into that table. All other selections under Actions can be kept the same. 
    - Click **Save** to update the changes, and return to the DataStage flow.

        ![datastage_snowflake_44](assets/datastage_snowflake_44.png)
        ![datastage_snowflake_45](assets/datastage_snowflake_45.png)<br><br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Add Transformation Nodes
Duration: 5

Now you have a basic DataStage flow to load the data into Snowflake. Follow these steps to add two nodes to join and filter the data: <br><br>

**Asset connector node**
1. In the node palette, expand the **Connectors** section.<br>
2. Drag the **Asset browser** connector on to the canvas close to the MORTGAGE_APPLICATION node.<br>
3. When you drop the *Asset Browser* connector on the canvas, you are prompted to select the asset.
    - To locate the asset, select **Connection > Data Fabric Trial - Db2 Warehouse > BANKING > MORTGAGE_APPLICANT. Note**: To expand the connection and schema, click the connection or schema name instead of the checkbox.
    - Click **Add** to drop the Db2 Warehouse data source onto the DataStage canvas.

        ![datastage_snowflake_46](assets/datastage_snowflake_46.png)<br><br>

4. Double-click the **MORTGAGE_APPLICANT** node to see its settings.
    - Click the **Output** tab.
    - Check the **Runtime column propagation** option. DataStage is flexible about metadata. It can handle where metadata is not fully defined. In this case, we select **Runtime column propagation** so that if the DataStage job encounters extra columns that are not defined in the metadata when it actually runs, it adopts these extra columns and propagates them through the rest of the job. This feature allows your flow design to be flexible for schema drift. 
    - Click **Save**.

        ![datastage_snowflake_47](assets/datastage_snowflake_47.png)<br><br>

**Check your progress**: The following image shows what the DataStage flow should look like after adding in the *Mortgage_Applicant* node. You are now ready to add in the join and filter nodes.
