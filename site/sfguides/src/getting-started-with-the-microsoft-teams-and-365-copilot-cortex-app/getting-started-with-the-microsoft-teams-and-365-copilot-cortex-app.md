# Getting Started with The Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilot Cortex App
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

The Microsoft M365 Copilot and Snowflake Cortex Agents integration simplifies AI-powered data interactions so that both technical and business users can interact with their structured and unstructured data using natural language. Direct access to Cortex Agents from Microsoft M365 Copilot makes it possible to combine powerful generative AI data agents with secure data in Snowflake, unlocking endless business efficiencies for every organization, from faster customer support to optimized supply chain operations.

In this quickstart, you’ll learn to build a Snowflake Cortex Agent App and connect to it from  Microsoft Teams or Microsoft M365 Copilot. After setting up the Snowflake Environment there will be a section for configuring the app connectivity followed by a use case showing how to run the application depending on your role and desired outcomes.

Snowflake Cortex Agents orchestrate across both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver insights. They plan tasks, use tools to execute these tasks, and generate responses. Agents use Cortex Analyst (structured) and Cortex Search (unstructured) as tools, along with LLMs, to analyze data. Cortex Search extracts insights from unstructured sources, while Cortex Analyst generates SQL to process structured data. A comprehensive support for tool identification and tool execution enables delivery of sophisticated applications grounded in enterprise data.

The Microsoft Teams and  M365 Copilot app is an AI-powered productivity assistant integrated into Microsoft Teams and Microsoft M365 Services (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.). It's part of Microsoft’s broader Copilot ecosystem, which embeds generative AI into everyday work apps and can connect to services like Snowflake Cortex Agents.

CURRENTLY THIS IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SNOWFLAKE ACCOUNTS DEPLOYED IN AZURE US EAST 2

### Use Case
In this use cases we will build two data sources, one with structured sales data and another with unstructured sales call data. Then we will create a Cortex Agent that uses Search (for unstructured data) and Analyst (for structured data) then wrap a Cortex Agent around it so that it can combine both the services in a unified agentic experience. This can then be used by Copilot leveraging oauth authentication and triggered by a simple phrase in your Microsoft Copilot to access sales data easily with plain text questions.

Snowflake Cortex has proven to be a best-in-class platform for building GenAI services (Search and Analyst) and agents with your data and now customers can seamlessly connect to Cortex Agents in Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilots alongside all of their Microsoft GenAI experiences.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with [Snowflake](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_) and a Snowflake account
- A Microsoft Teams account or M365 Copilot (with administrator privileges if following that section)

### What You’ll Learn
- Creating Snowflake Cortex Services for Search, Analyst and Agents
- Securely connecting Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilot App to Cortex Agents
- Using the Microsoft Teams and M365 App with Cortex Agents!

First we will build a simple Cortex agent that leverages Analyst and Search Services on structured and unstructured data respectively.

![](assets/agentarch.png)

Next, we will configure connectivity to connect the Microsoft Teams/ M365 Copilot App to Cortex then use it, with the underlying architecture like below. 
![](assets/cortexteamsarch.png)
The authentication and user flow goes like this:

1. User authenticates to Entra ID and via the Bot Resource to authenticate into their Snowflake Account.
2. The user then interacts with the MS app and the Bot Resource sends the request, along with the token from step 1, to the Bot backend with the user.
3. The Bot Backend stores and retrieves the tenant level configuration and prompts the Cortex Agent API and executes queries against the SQL API when needed.
4. Responses traverse through the Bot Backend, through the Bot Resource back to the application and to the user.

...

### What You’ll Need

CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE models DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);
```

Now we will have to set up a semantic model for Cortex Analyst.


Setting up Cortex Analyst
- Go to **AI * ML** on the side and select **Cortex Analyst**.
- Select the SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA Database and Schema.
- Select **Create New** and select **Create new Semantic View**.
 ![](assets/analystui.png)

 Select the MODELS Stage and name the Analyst Service SALES_METRICS_MODEL and select **Next**.
 - Select the SALES_INTELLIGENCE database and the SALES_METRICS table then select **Next**.
 - Select all of the columns and select **Create and Save**.

 This is a VERY simple Analyst service. You can click through the dimensions and see that Cortex used LLMS to write descriptions and synonyms for each of the dimensions. We're going to leave this as-is, but know that you can adjust this as needed to enhance the performance of Cortex Analyst.
 ![](assets/builtanalyst.png)

Setting up Cortex Agent
- Go to **AI * ML** on the side and select **Cortex Analyst**.
- Select the SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA Database and Schema.
- Select **Create Agent**.
- Name the agent SALES_INTELLIGENCE_AGENT and create the agent.
![](assets/salesintelligence.png)

Let's add the tools and orchestration to the agent
- Select **Edit** in the top right.
- Select **Tools** and **Add** by Cortex Analyst.
- Select the SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA Database and Schema and Select the SALES_METRICS_MODEL and generate a Description with Cortex AI.
- Select **Add**
![](assets/analysttoolui.png)

- Select **Add** by Cortex Search.
- Select the SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA Database and Schema and Select the SALES_CONVERSATION_SEARCH.
- Enter the name SALES_CONVERSATION_SEARCH and enter the description "the search service is for providing information on sales call transcripts".
- Select CONVERSATION_ID as the ID column and CUSTOMER_NAME as the Title Column.
- Select **Add**.
![](assets/searchtoolui.png)

- Select **Orchestration** and s leave the model set to **auto**.
- Add the following orchestration instructions, "use the analyst tool for sales metric and the search tool for call details".
- Add the following response instructions, "make the response concise and direct so that a strategic sales person can quickly understand the information provided".
- Select **Save**.

And last we will run this below script to grant the appropriate privileges to the PUBLIC role (or whatever role you can use). 

```sql
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_AGENT_USER TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SALES_INTELLIGENCE TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA DATA TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT ON SALES_METRICS_VIEW TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT ON SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA.SALES_METRICS TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE SALES_CONVERSATION_SEARCH TO ROLE PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE SALES_INTELLIGENCE_WH TO ROLE PUBLIC;
```
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## App Connectivity

A Global Administrator for your Microsoft Entra ID tenant must use the two links below to grant the necessary permissions for the applications. Please review the permissions requested on each consent screen before accepting.

Replace <TENANT-ID> with your organization’s tenant identifier:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT-ID>/adminconsent?client_id=5a840489-78db-4a42-8772-47be9d833efe
```

![](assets/consentone.png)

Replace <TENANT-ID> with your organization’s tenant identifier:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT-ID>/adminconsent?client_id=bfdfa2a2-bce5-4aee-ad3d-41ef70eb5086
```

![](assets/consenttwo.png)

Admins should also make sure the Snowflake users have an email address in their Snowflake user that matches their Microsoft tenant.

Admins should execute the below code to create the security integration necessary to authenticate with Entra ID.
 <TENANT-ID> with your organization’s tenant identifier:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION entra_id_cortex_agents_integration 
TYPE = EXTERNAL_OAUTH 
ENABLED = TRUE 
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = AZURE 
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT-ID>/v2.0'
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT-ID>/discovery/v2.0/keys'
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ('5a840489-78db-4a42-8772-47be9d833efe') EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = ('email', 'upn')
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'email_address' 
EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ANY_ROLE_MODE = 'ENABLE'
```
Search for "Snowflake Cortex Agents" in the Microsoft Teams App Store and click "Add".

The first user from your organization to interact with the agent will be guided through a one-time setup process to connect your Snowflake account for the whole organization. This user must have administrative permissions in the target Snowflake account to complete the setup.

Depending on your organization’s Microsoft Teams policies, a Microsoft Teams Administrator may need to approve or unblock the application before it is available to users. Reach to [Overview of app management and governance in Microsoft Teams admin center”](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-apps) article in order to get more information on managing access to Microsoft Teams Applications across an organization.

Upon the first interaction with the agent, you will be prompted to log in with your Microsoft account.

The agent will inform you that no Snowflake account is configured for your organization and will ask for your Snowflake account URL. Clicking “I’m the Snowflake administrator” action will unveil a simple form, where you can provide your account’s URL.
-The full URL to enter is your_organization-your_account.snowflakecomputing.com.
![](assets/adminscreen.png)

If all checks pass, the Snowflake configuration has been successfully added for your organization. All users from your Microsoft tenant can now interact with the agent using this Snowflake account.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Run Application

Access the App from M365 Copilot or Microsoft Teams experience. The experience will be mostly the same with some minor variations in the UI. See the two screenshots below.

#### Microsoft Teams
![](assets/openteamsagent.png)

#### M365 Copilot
![](assets/opencopilotagent.png)


You can start by asking "view available commands" to then access the admin panel, get help or choose a new snowflake account.
![](assets/viewcommands.png)


Ask by typing "what was the largest deal size" to see the answer.
![](assets/answer.png)

And you are now ready to go! You can continue asking questions like:
- Plot our largest deals by deal size?
- How was the call with Securebank?
- What was the worst customer call we had?
- Show the deals that are currently pending

The Snowflake Cortex Teams and M365 App now supports the below functionality. Users are encouraged to expand on this use case to explore its complete functionality

:busts_in_silhouette: Multi-Agent Support: Users can now use and switch between multiple agents across multiple Snowflake accounts.

:left_speech_bubble: Multi-Turn Conversations: Stateful conversations are now supported via the new Threads API, providing a genuine chatbot experience.

:brain: Improved Reasoning & UX: Agents now use a multi-step “Reasoning Path” for tools, and the UI shows “thinking” traces and status updates.
