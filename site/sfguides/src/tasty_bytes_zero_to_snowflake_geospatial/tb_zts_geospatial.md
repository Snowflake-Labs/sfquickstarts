## Acquiring SafeGraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace
Duration: 1

### Overview
Tasty Bytes operates Food Trucks in numerous cities and countries across the globe with each truck having the ability to choose two different selling locations per day.

One important item that our Executives are interested in is to learn more about how these locations relate to each other as well as if there are any locations we currently serve that are potentially too far away from hot selling city centers.

Unfortunately what we have seen so far is our first party data does not give us the building blocks required to complete this sort of Geospatial analysis. Thankfully, the Snowflake Marketplace has great listings from SafeGraph that can assist us here.


### Step 1 - Using First Party Data to Find Top Selling Locations
Before we leverage the Snowflake Marketplace to access SafeGraph Point of Interest data, please execute our first three queries which will set our Role and Warehouse context to `tasty_data_engineer` and `tasty_de_wh` and find the Top 10 Selling Locations for Paris in 2022.

In our third query we will see the usage of [TOP](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/top_n), [SUM](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/sum) and [YEAR](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/year) functions.

```
USE ROLE tasty_data_engineer;
USE WAREHOUSE tasty_de_wh;

SELECT TOP 10
    o.location_id,
    SUM(o.price) AS total_sales_usd
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
WHERE 1=1
    AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
    AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
GROUP BY o.location_id
ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC;
```

<img src = "assets/3.1.top_selling.png">

While it is great to get these top selling locations for Paris, we need more Point of Interest data to really derive any insights.

### Step 2 - Acquiring SafeGraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace 
Please follow the steps and video below to access this listing in your Snowflake Account.

- Click -> Home Icon
- Click -> Marketplace
- Search -> frostbyte
- Click -> SafeGraph: frostbyte
- Click -> Get
- Rename Database -> FROSTBYTE_SAFEGRAPH (all capital letters)
- Grant to Additional Roles -> PUBLIC

<img src = "assets/acquire_safegraph.gif">

>aside positive
>SafeGraph’s Places data provides detailed information about physical places. Our data is fresh, cleaned and provided in a format that empowers the user. With POI data for countries around the world, you can gain insights about any location that a person can visit aside from private residences. 
>

### Step 3 - Evaluating SafeGraph POI Data
Now that we have the `frostbyte_safegraph` database live in our account, let's run the next query to initially see what sort of data they have available for Paris.

```
SELECT 
    cpg.placekey,
    cpg.location_name,
    cpg.longitude,
    cpg.latitude,
    cpg.street_address,
    cpg.city,
    cpg.country,
    cpg.polygon_wkt
FROM frostbyte_safegraph.public.frostbyte_tb_safegraph_s cpg
WHERE 1=1
    AND cpg.top_category = 'Museums, Historical Sites, and Similar Institutions'
    AND cpg.sub_category = 'Museums'
    AND cpg.city = 'Paris'
    AND cpg.country = 'France';
```

<img src = "assets/3.3.safegraph_paris.png">

**Amazing!** These sort of POI metrics will be immensely valuable in conducting Geospatial analysis to assist our Executives in making data driven location decisions. 

Let's get this harmonized with our Sales data in the next section.

### Step 4 - Click Next -->

## Harmonizing and Promoting First and Third Party Data
Duration: 1

### Overview
To make our Geospatial analysis seamless, let's make sure to get SafeGraph POI data included in the `analytics.orders_v` so all of our downstream users can also access it.

### Step 1 - Enriching our Analytics View
Please execute this steps two queries which will first set our Role context to `sysadmin` and then enrich our `analytics.orders_v` by adding all available, new  SafeGraph POI metrics.

Within this [CREATE VIEW](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-view) statement, you will see [COMMENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/comment), [DATE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_date) and [SELECT * EXCLUDE ..](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/select#parameters) functionality leveraged. 

To highlight what our EXCLUDE is doing we are using it to simplify the SQL required to SELECT all of the available SafeGraph columns but not the ones we already have available in the `harmonized.orders_v`.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v
COMMENT = 'Tasty Bytes Order Detail View'
    AS
SELECT 
    DATE(o.order_ts) AS date,
    o.* ,
    cpg.* EXCLUDE (location_id, region, phone_number, country)
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.harmonized.orders_v o
JOIN frostbyte_safegraph.public.frostbyte_tb_safegraph_s cpg
    ON o.location_id = cpg.location_id;
```

<img src = "assets/4.1.view.png">

>aside negative
> **Note:** For demonstration purposes the SafeGraph listing already has the Tasty Bytes *location_id's* included within. In a real-world scenario the mapping would leverage public [Placekeys](https://www.placekey.io/) which [SafeGraph is a founding partner of](https://www.safegraph.com/blogs/safegraph-joins-placekey-initiative-as-a-founding-partner).

## Conducting Geospatial Analysis - Part 1
Duration: 2

### Overview
With Point of Interest metrics now readily available from the Snowflake Marketplace without any ETL required, let's start on our Geospatial analysis journey.

### Step 1 - Creating a Geography Point
Latitude and Longitude are two building block POI metrics we now have access to thanks for SafeGraph. 

Please execute the next two queries to re-assume to `tasty_data_engineer` role and create our Geography Point leveraging the [ST_MAKEPOINT/ST_POINT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_makepoint) function.

>aside positive
> **ST_MAKEPOINT/ST_POINT:** Constructs a GEOGRAPHY object that represents a point with the specified longitude and latitude.
>

```
USE ROLE tasty_date_engineer;

SELECT TOP 10 
    o.location_id,
    ST_MAKEPOINT(o.longitude, o.latitude) AS geo_point,
    SUM(o.price) AS total_sales_usd
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
WHERE 1=1
    AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
    AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
GROUP BY o.location_id, o.latitude, o.longitude
ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC;
```

<img src = "assets/5.1.st_makepoint.png">

While it isn't the prettiest result set we have ever seen, the results we see in the `geo_point` column are going to be essential for everything else we do moving forward. 

One thing to note here is despite typically hearing Latitude then Longitude this function requires these values to be input in the Longitude, Latitude order.

### Step 2 - Calculating Distance Between Locations
Starting with our Geographic Point, we can now begin to dive into some of the powerful Geospatial functions Snowflake offers natively. 

Let's first start with calculating the distances in Miles and Kilometers between those top selling locations we generated previously by executing our next query which leverages the powerful [ST_DISTANCE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_distance) function.

>aside positive
>**ST_DISTANCE:** Returns the minimum geodesic distance between two GEOGRAPHY or the minimum Euclidean distance between two GEOMETRY objects.
>

Within this query we also leverage a [Common Table Expression or CTE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/queries-cte), [QUALIFY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/qualify) and [LAG](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/lag).

```
WITH _top_10_locations AS 
(
    SELECT TOP 10
        o.location_id,
        ST_MAKEPOINT(o.longitude, o.latitude) AS geo_point,
        SUM(o.price) AS total_sales_usd
    FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
    WHERE 1=1
        AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
        AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
    GROUP BY o.location_id, o.latitude, o.longitude
    ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC
)
SELECT
    a.location_id,
    b.location_id,
    ROUND(ST_DISTANCE(a.geo_point, b.geo_point)/1609,2) AS geography_distance_miles,
    ROUND(ST_DISTANCE(a.geo_point, b.geo_point)/1000,2) AS geography_distance_kilometers
FROM _top_10_locations a  
JOIN _top_10_locations b
    ON a.location_id <> b.location_id
QUALIFY a.location_id <> LAG(b.location_id) OVER (ORDER BY geography_distance_miles)
ORDER BY geography_distance_miles;
```

<img src = "assets/5.2.st_distance.png">

**Wow!** Look at how far we have already came in so little time. Let's keep diving deeper into what Geospatial insights we can derive in our next section.

### Step 3 - Click Next -->

## Conducting Geospatial Analysis - Part 2
Duration: 3

### Overview
Now that we understand how to create points, and calculate distance, we will now pile on a large set additional Snowflake Geospatial functionality to further our analysis.

### Step 1 - Collecting Points, Drawing a Minimum Bounding Polygon and Calculating Area
Please execute the next query which will take the building blocks from the previous section and now collect all of our Geography Points and build a Minimum Bounding Polygon from them.

Within this query we will see the usage of [ST_NPOINTS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_npoints), [ST_COLLECT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_collect), [ST_ENVELOPE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_envelope) and [ST_AREA](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_area).

>aside positive
>**ST_NPOINTS/ST_NUMPOINTS:** Returns the number of points in a GEOGRAPHY or GEOGRAPHY object.
>
>**ST_COLLECT:** This function combines all the GEOGRAPHY objects in a column into one GEOGRAPHY object.
>
>**ST_ENVELOPE:** Returns the minimum bounding box (a rectangular “envelope”) that encloses a specified GEOMETRY object.
>
>**ST_AREA:** Returns the area of the Polygon(s) in a GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY object.
>

```
WITH _top_10_locations AS 
(
    SELECT TOP 10
        o.location_id,
        ST_MAKEPOINT(o.longitude, o.latitude) AS geo_point,
        SUM(o.price) AS total_sales_usd
    FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
    WHERE 1=1
        AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
        AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
    GROUP BY o.location_id, o.latitude, o.longitude
    ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC
)
SELECT
    ST_NPOINTS(ST_COLLECT(tl.geo_point)) AS count_points_in_collection,
    ST_COLLECT(tl.geo_point) AS collection_of_points,
    ST_ENVELOPE(collection_of_points) AS minimum_bounding_polygon,
    ROUND(ST_AREA(minimum_bounding_polygon)/1000000,2) AS area_in_sq_kilometers
FROM _top_10_locations tl;
```

<img src = "assets/6.1.collect_draw_area.png">

**Holy Cow!** Look at how much we accomplished within a single SQL query, but we can't stop yet, let's keep going to see what else we can accomplish.

### Step 2 - Finding our Top Selling Locations Center Point
Now that we have collected geographic information about where our Trucks sell the most in Paris.  Please execute the next query which will utilize [ST_CENTROID](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_centroid) to find the top selling center point.

>aside positive
>**ST_CENTROID:** Returns the Point representing the geometric center of a GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY object.
>

```
WITH _top_10_locations AS 
(
    SELECT TOP 10
        o.location_id,
        ST_MAKEPOINT(o.longitude, o.latitude) AS geo_point,
        SUM(o.price) AS total_sales_usd
    FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
    WHERE 1=1
        AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
        AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
    GROUP BY o.location_id, o.latitude, o.longitude
    ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC
)
SELECT  
    ST_COLLECT(tl.geo_point) AS collect_points,
    ST_CENTROID(collect_points) AS geometric_center_point
FROM _top_10_locations tl;
```

<img src = "assets/6.2.st_centroid.png">

Once again this result set isn't the most beautiful thing to look at, but the insights this sort of information can unlock is what we are truly after.

### Step 3 - Storing our Center Point in a Variable
So we can use this Center Point of our Top Selling locations in a future query, please copy what is displayed in the `geometric_center_point` from the previous query and paste into between the quotes in this steps query (screenshot of this process below). 

``
SET center_point = ' ';
``

Once pasted in, please execute the query which will yield a `Statement executed succesfully.` message. 

<img src = "assets/6.3.set_var.gif">

Now we can use this `center_point` Variable to help conclude our Geospatial analysis.

### Step 4 - Finding Locations Furthest Away from our Top Selling Center Point
As mentioned earlier, our Tasty Bytes Executives are interested in seeing what locations we may want to stop having our Food Trucks visit in their weekly schedules. Thankfully, every step we have taken so far has now enabled us to deliver on this exact request.

Please now kick off the final query of this Quickstart so we can identify which Paris locations we may want to take off our schedules. Within the query we will see a new function we haven't used yet, [TO_GEOGRAPHY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_geography).

```
WITH _2022_paris_locations AS
(
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        o.location_id,
        o.location_name,
        ST_MAKEPOINT(o.longitude, o.latitude) AS geo_point
    FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes.analytics.orders_v o
    WHERE 1=1
        AND o.primary_city = 'Paris'
        AND YEAR(o.date) = 2022
)
SELECT TOP 50
    ll.location_id,
    ll.location_name,
    ROUND(ST_DISTANCE(ll.geo_point, TO_GEOGRAPHY($center_point))/1000,2) AS kilometer_from_top_selling_center
FROM _2022_paris_locations ll
ORDER BY kilometer_from_top_selling_center DESC;
```

<img src = "assets/6.4.far_out.png">

Fantastic work! We have now delivered on the exact as from our Executive Team via a simple process through leveraging SafeGraph from the Snowflake Marketplace. I think we can officially call this a job well done.
