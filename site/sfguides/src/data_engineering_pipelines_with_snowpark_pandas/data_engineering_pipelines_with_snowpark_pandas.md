# Data Engineering Pipeline with pandas on Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Through this quickstart, you will learn how to use [Snowflake Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks), [pandas on Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowpark/python/snowpark-pandas), [Git integration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-snowgit), and [Serverless Tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro) to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline.

You will create a customer profile using the [Snowflake Sample TPC-H dataset](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpch), save it into a Snowflake table and to create a serverless task to schedule the feature engineering.

### What is pandas on Snowflake?

pandas on Snowflake lets you run your pandas code in a distributed manner scalably and securely directly on your data in Snowflake. Just by changing the import statement and a few lines of code, you can get the same pandas-native experience you know and love with the scalability and security benefits of Snowflake. With pandas on Snowflake this API, you can work with much larger datasets and avoid the time and expense of porting your pandas pipelines to other big data frameworks or provisioning large and expensive machines. It runs workloads natively in Snowflake through transpilation to SQL, enabling it to take advantage of parallelization and the data governance and security benefits of Snowflake. 

### Why use pandas on Snowflake?
pandas is the go-to data processing library for millions worldwide, including countless Snowflake users. However, pandas was never built to handle data at the scale organizations are operating today. Running pandas code requires transferring and loading all of the data into a single in-memory process. It becomes unwieldy on moderate-to-large data sets and breaks down completely on data sets that grow beyond what a single node can handle. With pandas on Snowflake, you can run the same pandas code, but with all the pandas processing pushed down to run in a distributed fashion in Snowflake. Your data never leaves Snowflake, and your pandas workflows can process much more efficiently using the Snowflake elastic engine. This brings the power of Snowflake to pandas developers everywhere.

pandas on Snowflake is delivered through the Snowpark pandas API as part of the Snowpark Python library, which enables scalable data processing of Python code within the Snowflake platform. You will learn how to use Snowpark pandas as part of this quickstart. This quickstart will focus on getting started with Snowpark pandas API, and enable you to perform common pandas operations on large volumes of data while leveraging the power of Snowflake.

## Setup The Snowflake Environment
Duration: 10

### Overview
This section covers cloning of the GitHub repository and creating the needed Snowflake objects (i.e role, warehouse, database, schema, etc..)

### Clone The Git Repository
The very first step is to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-data-engineering-pipelines-with-pandas-on-snowflake). This repository contains all the code you will need to successfully complete this QuickStart Guide.

Using HTTPS:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-data-engineering-pipelines-with-pandas-on-snowflake.git
```

OR, using SSH:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-data-engineering-pipelines-with-pandas-on-snowflake.git
```

You can also use the Git integration feature of Snowflake Notebooks, in order to do that you need to fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-data-engineering-pipelines-with-pandas-on-snowflake) to be allowed to commit changes. For instructions how to set up Git integration for your Snowflake account see [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/git/git-setting-up) and for using it with Snowflake Notebooks see [this page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-snowgit). You can refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOa1eUccmQ) for a walkthrough on how you can set up Git integration and use it with Snowflake Notebooks.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setup Snowflake

Duration: 10

During this step you will verify that the [Snowflake Sample TPC-H dataset](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpch) is available in your account, and if not add the share.

### Verify That The Snowflake Sample TPC-H Dataset Is Available

1. Log into [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#) for your account
2. Navigate to **Databases**
3. Verify that you can see the **SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA** database, if it is missing then you can add it folling the instructions [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-using).

### Create Database, Schema And Warehouse To Be Used

```SQL
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE DATABASE SNOW_PANDAS_DE_QS;
CREATE SCHEMA SNOW_PANDAS_DE_QS.NOTEBOOKS;
CREATE SCHEMA SNOW_PANDAS_DE_QS.DATA;

CREATE WAREHOUSE SNOW_PANDAS_DE_QS_WH;
```
