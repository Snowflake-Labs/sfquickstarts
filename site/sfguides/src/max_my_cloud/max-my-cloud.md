![status](assets/status.png)

### Monitor Status Overview

Once installation is complete, the following monitors will be available:

### 1. üîç Query Monitor

Tracks and analyzes Snowflake query activity. Email alerts can be configured to flag unusual or resource-intensive queries.

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Warehouse Monitor

Monitors warehouse workload. If a warehouse remains idle beyond a pre-defined threshold, it will be automatically be **suspended** to reduce costs.

Note: This monitor is disabled by default.

### 3. üèóÔ∏è Warehouse Scheduler

The Warehouse Scheduler enables administrators to configure Snowflake warehouse properties based on the time of day and day of the week (Weekdays, Saturday, Sunday). This is particularly beneficial for workloads with variable resource demands throughout the day or week, enabling optimized performance and cost efficiency.

### 4. üí∞ Budget Monitor

Allows you to define BU (Business Unit) budgets. If usage trends indicate a potential budget overrun, alerts are triggered proactively.

Note: This monitor is disabled by default.

## Complete Setup

### Prerequisites

Before using the Web UI, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Get the MaxMyCloud Native App on Snowflake**
2. **Create Snowflake User for Web UI Access**

### Create Role
Execute the following SQL in your Snowflake worksheet to create the required role:

```SQL 
create role maxmycloud_role;
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE app_maxmycloud TO ROLE maxmycloud_role;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE your_warehouse TO ROLE maxmycloud_role;
GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION MAXMYCLOUD_API_INTEGRATION TO maxmycloud_role;
```

### Choose Authentication Method

You can create the user using either:

1. **Username & Password** ‚Äì For testing only
2. **Key Pair Authentication** ‚Äì Recommended for production

### Key Pair Authentication (Recommended)
### Step 1: Generate Key Pair

Run these commands locally to generate your private and public key:

```terminal
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt
```

```terminal
openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
```
### Step 2: Create the Snowflake User

```terminal

CREATE OR REPLACE USER maxmycloud
PASSWORD = ''  -- Ensure No password for key-pair method
LOGIN_NAME = 'maxmycloud'
DISPLAY_NAME = 'maxmycloud'
DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = 'your_warehouse'
DEFAULT_ROLE = 'maxmycloud_role'
DISABLED = FALSE;

GRANT ROLE maxmycloud_role TO USER maxmycloud;
        
```


### Step 3: Assign the Public Key

Replace the example key below with the contents of your generated rsa_key.pub file:

```terminal 
ALTER USER maxmycloud SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';
```

That‚Äôs it for Snowflake configuration. Save your key files securely before proceeding.

MaxMyCloud utilizes the Snowflake Query History API, allowing you to build conditions based on any fields the API provides. For a complete list, refer to the [Snowflake Documentation.](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/query_history)

**MaxMyCloud also provides built-in functions to refine your conditions:**


| Function       | Description                                                        | Example                                                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| CREDIT_USED()  | Returns the amount of credits consumed by a query.                 | credit_used() > 1 (Alert if query uses more than 1 credit.)    |
| RUN_HOUR()     | Returns the hour of the day (0‚Äì23) when the query is running.      | query_tag = 'FINISH BY 2am' AND run_hour() > 2                 |
| RUN_MINUTE()   | Returns the minute of the hour (0‚Äì59) when the query is running.   | run_minute() > 30 (Query running past 30 minutes into the hour.) |
| RUN_TIME()     | Returns the current time of day when the query is running in HH:MM format. | run_time() > '14:00' (Query still running after 2:00 PM.) |


- **Cancel:** Optionally kill the query automatically if the condition is met.
- **Emails:** List of recipient email addresses for alert notifications.

Click **Save** to return to the list of Query Monitors.

### Alerts

If a running query meets a defined condition, alert emails are sent to the specified recipients.

- **Example 1:** A query is automatically cancelled when it violates a condition.

![violate_1](assets/violate_1.png)

- **Example 2:** A query violates a condition, but is not cancelled ‚Äî an email notification is still sent to alert administrators.

![violate_2](assets/violate_2.png)


## Warehouse Scheduler

### Purpose

The **Warehouse Scheduler** enables administrators to configure Snowflake warehouse properties based on the time of day and day of the week (Weekdays, Saturday, Sunday). This is particularly beneficial for workloads with variable resource demands throughout the day or week, enabling optimized performance and cost efficiency.

### Creating, Editing, or Deleting a Warehouse Schedule

1. Navigate to **Operations ‚Üí WH Schedule**. A list of available Snowflake warehouses will be displayed.
2. Locate the warehouse you wish to schedule and click **"Schedule"** in the **Action** column.
If the warehouse is not yet scheduled, an informational window will appear. Click the blue **"Enable Schedule"** button in the window.
3. You will be directed to the Scheduler screen.
By default, the schedule spans from **00:00 to 23:59** for **Weekday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday** sections.

![warehouse_scheduler](assets/warehouse_scheduler.png)

4. Click ‚Äú+‚Äù to add a new time range during which warehouse properties should change.
Click ‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù to remove an existing time range.
5. A pop-up window will appear when adding or editing a schedule.

![add_time](assets/add_time.png)

6. Enter the desired warehouse settings (e.g., size, auto-suspend) and click **"Add"** or **"Save".**
Note: Time selection is in 15-minute increments. Minutes must be either **00, 15, 30,** or **45.**
7. You will return to the Warehouse Scheduler screen for the selected warehouse.
Review the configured time ranges and property settings.

![warehouse_scheduler2](assets/warehouse_scheduler2.png)

8. If the configuration looks correct, click "Save Changes" to store the schedule in the database.
The new schedule will take effect immediately.
9. To disable scheduling, click the red "Disable Schedule" button.

### Note

- All schedule times are displayed in your configured time zone, indicated in blue on the Scheduler page.
- To change your time zone, navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Timezone.**

## Warehouse Monitor

### Purpose

The **Warehouse Monitor** continuously monitors all warehouses in your Snowflake account and automatically suspends any warehouse that remains active beyond a specified inactivity threshold. This helps avoid unnecessary compute costs by acting as a safeguard against accidentally leaving warehouses running idle.

> **Note:** This tool is not intended to replace Snowflake‚Äôs native *auto-suspend* feature.  
> We strongly recommend setting Snowflake‚Äôs auto-suspend to **60 seconds** instead of relying on the Snowflake default to maximize cost efficiency.  
> The Warehouse Monitor acts as a safeguard to ensure warehouses are not inadvertently left running idle.

### Configuration Guide

Navigate to **Operations ‚Üí WH Schedule.** A list of available Snowflake warehouses will be displayed.

![WarehouseMonitor](assets/WarehouseMonitor.png)

1. **Define the Inactivity Threshold:**  
   Set the inactivity threshold (in seconds) between 0 and 60. While any value is permitted,  
   we recommend staying under 60 seconds. You may also exclude specific warehouses  
   from this threshold.

2. **Select Warehouse Sizes to Monitor:**  
   Choose which warehouse sizes to monitor. You can either select all sizes or target  
   specific ones depending on your cost management strategy.

3. **Include or Exclude Specific Warehouses:**  
   Use the *Include* or *Exclude* radio options in the configuration table to refine which  
   warehouses are affected by the monitor.

4. Once configuration is complete, click the **‚ÄúSave & Monitor‚Äù** button to activate monitoring.

### Enabling & Disabling the Monitor

- The Warehouse Monitor is **disabled by default.** It will not begin monitoring until you explicitly activate it by clicking **‚ÄúSave & Monitor.‚Äù**
- To stop monitoring at any time, click the **‚ÄúDisable Monitor‚Äù** button.
