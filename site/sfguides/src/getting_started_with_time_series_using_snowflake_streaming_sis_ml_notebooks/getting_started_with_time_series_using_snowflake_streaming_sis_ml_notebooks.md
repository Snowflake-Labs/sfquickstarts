3. Enter command `conda activate hol-timeseries`

<img src="assets/labsetup_condaactivate.png" />

<img src="assets/labsetup_condaactivated.png" />

The terminal prompt should now show a prefix `(hol-timeseries)` to confirm the **hol-timeseries** virtual environment is activated.


### Step 4 - Update Snowflake Connection Account Identifiers in Lab Files

1. Login to your Snowflake account using a browser 

2. From the menu expand `Projects > Worksheets`

<img src="assets/analysis_worksheets.png" />

3. At the top right of the **Worksheets** screen, select `+ > SQL Worksheet`. This will open a new worksheet in Snowsight.

<img src="assets/analysis_newworksheet.png" />

4. **In the new worksheet**, execute the following command that uses [SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_allowlist) to find your **ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER**:

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(AL.VALUE:host::VARCHAR, '.snowflakecomputing.com', '') AS ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER
FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(input => PARSE_JSON(SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST()))) AS AL
WHERE AL.VALUE:type::VARCHAR = 'SNOWFLAKE_DEPLOYMENT_REGIONLESS';
```

5. In the results returned, below the command, select the row returned, and **Copy** the **ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER**.

<img src="assets/labsetup_regionless.png" />

6. Back in **VS Code**, navigate to the following files and in the files replace **<ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER>** with your Snowflake account identifier value:

* `.snowflake/config.toml`
    - **account** variable for **both** connections

## Snowpipe Streaming Ingestion
Duration: 10

With the foundational objects setup, we can now **deploy a staging table** to stream time series data into Snowflake via a Snowpipe Streaming client.

For this lab a **Java IOT Simulator Client** application has been created to stream IoT sensor readings into Snowflake.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_streamingest.png" />


### Step 1 - Create Streaming Staging Table

We'll create a stage loading table to stream RAW time series data into Snowflake. This will be located in the **STAGING** schema of the **HOL_TIMESERIES** database.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_stagetable.png" />

In the **GitHub Codespace VS Code** open worksheet: `worksheets/hol_timeseries_2_ingest.sql`

1. Run the **Staging Table** script to create the IoT stream staging table.

```sql
/*##############################
-- Staging Table - START
##############################*/

-- Set role, context, and warehouse
USE ROLE ROLE_HOL_TIMESERIES;
USE SCHEMA HOL_TIMESERIES.STAGING;
USE WAREHOUSE HOL_TRANSFORM_WH;

-- Setup staging tables - RAW_TS_IOTSTREAM_DATA
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE HOL_TIMESERIES.STAGING.RAW_TS_IOTSTREAM_DATA (
    RECORD_METADATA VARIANT,
    RECORD_CONTENT VARIANT
)
CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE
COMMENT = 'IOTSTREAM staging table.'
;

/*##############################
-- Staging Table - END
##############################*/
```

The IoT data will be streamed into Snowflake in a similar [schema format as Kafka](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/kafka-connector-overview#schema-of-tables-for-kafka-topics) which contains two columns:
- **RECORD_CONTENT** - This contains the Kafka message.
- **RECORD_METADATA** - This contains metadata about the message, for example, the topic from which the message was read.

> aside negative
> 
> There are **EXTERNAL ACTIVITY** sections in the worksheet, which will be executed within the **GitHub Codespace** terminal. Details in the next steps.
>


#### INFO: Snowpipe Streaming Ingest Client SDK

Snowflake provides an [Ingest Client SDK](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.snowflake/snowflake-ingest-sdk) in Java that allows applications, such as Kafka Connectors, to stream rows of data into a Snowflake table at low latency.

<img src="assets/data-load-snowpipe-streaming.png" />

The Ingest Client SDK is configured with a secure JDBC connection to Snowflake, and will establish a streaming [Channel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview#channels) between the client and a Snowflake table.

<img src="assets/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-client-channel.png" />


### Step 2 - Test Streaming Client

Now that a staging table is available to stream time series data. We can look at setting up a streaming connection channel with a Java Snowpipe Streaming client. The simulator Java application is available in the `iotstream` folder of the lab, and can be run via a terminal with a Java runtime.

> aside positive
> 
> The lab environment has been set up with a **Java Runtime** to execute the Java Snowpipe Streaming client application.
>

In the **GitHub Codespace VS Code**:

1. Open `Menu > Terminal > New Terminal` - a new terminal window will now open

<img src="assets/labsetup_newterminal.png" />

2. Change directory into to the **iotstream** folder: `cd iotstream`

```bash
cd iotstream
```

3. Run the `Test.sh` script to confirm a table channel stream can be established with Snowflake.

```bash
./Test.sh
```

> aside positive
> 
> If **successful**, it will return:
> `** Successfully Connected, Test complete! **`
>
> This will confirm that the Java streaming client is able to connect to Snowflake, and is able to establish a channel to the target table.
>

4. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_2_ingest.sql` and run the `SHOW CHANNELS` command to confirm a channel is now open to Snowflake.

```sql
SHOW CHANNELS;
```

The query should return a single channel `CHANNEL_1_TEST` opened to the `RAW_TS_IOTSTREAM_DATA` table.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_channeltest.png" />

**With a channel now opened to the table we are ready to stream data into the table.**


### Step 3 - Load a Simulated IoT Data Set

With the channel connection being successful, we can now load the IoT data set, as fast as the connection and machine will allow.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_streamingclient.png" />

The simulated **IoT dataset contains six sensor devices** at various frequencies, with each device being assigned a unique Tag Names within a single **namespace** called **"IOT"**.

| **Namespace** | **Tag Name** | **Frequency** | **Units** | **Data Type** | **Sensor Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IOT | TAG101 | 5 SEC | PSI | DOUBLE | Pressure Gauge |
| IOT | TAG201 | 10 SEC | RPM | DOUBLE | Motor RPM |
| IOT | TAG301 | 1 SEC | KPA | DOUBLE | Pressure Gauge |
| IOT | TAG401 | 60 SEC | CM3S | DOUBLE | Flow Sensor |
| IOT | TAG501 | 60 SEC | DEGF | DOUBLE | Temperature Gauge |
| IOT | TAG601 | 10 SEC | KPA | DOUBLE | Pressure Gauge |

1. In the **VS Code** `Terminal` run the `Run_MAX.sh` script to load the IoT data.

```bash
./Run_MAX.sh
```

> aside negative
> 
> Depending on the **speed of the machine** running the Java streaming client application, and the **network connectivity**, this may take a minute to load.
>

> aside positive
> 
> #### INFO: Java Streaming Client Application
>
> The **Java streaming client application** is being called using a **Terminal shell script**. The Java application accepts various speed input parameters to change the number of rows that are streamed. The **"MAX"** script will send as many rows as the device will allow to the **Snowpipe Streaming API** and into the target table.
>

2. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_2_ingest.sql` and run the `SHOW CHANNELS` command to confirm a new channel is now open to Snowflake.

```sql
SHOW CHANNELS;
```

The query should return a new channel `CHANNEL_1_MAX` opened to the `RAW_TS_IOTSTREAM_DATA` table, with an **offset_token** showing the number of rows loaded.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_channelmax.png" />

3. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_2_ingest.sql` and view the streamed records, by running the `Check stream table data` script.

```sql
-- Check stream table data
SELECT * FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.STAGING.RAW_TS_IOTSTREAM_DATA LIMIT 10;
```

- **RECORD_METADATA** - This contains metadata about IOT Tag reading.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_record_meta.png" />

- **RECORD_CONTENT** - This contains the IOT Tag reading.

<img src="assets/snowpipe_record_content.png" />

Each IoT device reading is a **JSON payload**, transmitted in the following Kafka like format:

```json
{
    "meta":
    {
        "LogAppendTime": "1714487166815",
        "headers":
        {
            "namespace": "IOT",
            "source": "STREAM_DATA.csv",
            "speed": "MAX"
        },
        "offset": "116",
        "partition": "1",
        "topic": "time-series"
    },

## Data Modeling and Transformation
Duration: 5

Now that data has been streamed into Snowflake, we are ready for some **Data Engineering** activities to get the data into a report ready state for analytics. We'll be **transforming the data** from the **JSON VARIANT** format into a tabular format. Using Snowflake **Dynamic Tables**, the data streamed into Snowflake will continuously update the analytics layers.

Along with setting up Dynamic Tables for continuous loading, we'll also deploy some **analytics views** for the consumer serving layer. This will allow for specific columns of data to be exposed to the end users and applications.

<img src="assets/model_dataengineering.png" />


#### INFO: Dynamic Tables

[Dynamic Tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-intro) are a declarative way of defining your data pipeline in Snowflake. It's a Snowflake table which is **defined as a query to continuously and automatically materialize the result of that query as a table**. Dynamic Tables can join and aggregate across **multiple source objects** and **incrementally update** results as sources change.

Dynamic Tables can also be chained together to create a DAG for more complex data pipelines.

<img src="assets/dynamic_tables.png" />


### Step 1 - Model Time Series Data with Dynamic Tables

For the IoT streaming data we'll setup two Dynamic Tables in a simple Dimension and Fact model:
- **DT_TS_TAG_METADATA (Dimension)**: Containing Tag Metadata such as tag names, sourcing, and data types
- **DT_TS_TAG_READINGS (Fact)**: Containing the readings from each IoT sensor in raw and numeric format

<img src="assets/model_dynamictables.png" />

In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_3_transform.sql` and run the **Dynamic Tables Setup** scripts.

```sql

> **Dynamic Tables** have a [TARGET_LAG](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh#label-dynamic-tables-understand-dt-lag) parameter, which defines a **target “freshness”** for the  data. In this case, we have configured the Dynamic Tables to have a TARGET_LAG of 1 minute, so we want the Dynamic Table to **update within 1 minute of the base tables being updated**.
>


### Step 2 - Review Dynamic Table Details

1. **Login to Snowflake**, and from the menu expand `Data > Databases > HOL_TIMESERIES > TRANSFORM > Dynamic Tables > DT_TS_TAG_METADATA > Refresh History`

**The DT_TS_TAG_METADATA table will show six rows loaded, representing the six tags of data streamed into Snowflake**.

<img src="assets/model_dynamictables_metadata.png" />

2. Open the `Data Preview` tab

**You can now see the Tag Metadata in a columnar table format**.

<img src="assets/model_dynamictables_metadata_preview.png" />

3. Select `Dynamic Tables > DT_TS_TAG_READINGS > Refresh History`

**The DT_TS_TAG_READINGS table will show all the tag readings streamed into Snowflake**.

<img src="assets/model_dynamictables_readings.png" />

4. Open the `Data Preview` tab

### Step 3 - Create Analytics Views for Consumers

The Dynamic Tables are now set up to continuously transform streaming data. We can now look at setting up a **Curated Analytics** serving layer with some views for end users and applications to consume the streaming data.

<img src="assets/model_analyticviews.png" />

We'll create a set of analytics views similar to the Dynamic Tables with a subset of columns in the **ANALYTICS** schema:
- **TS_TAG_REFERENCE (Dimension)**: Containing Tag Metadata such as tag names, sourcing, and data types
- **TS_TAG_READINGS (Fact)**: Containing the readings from each IoT sensor in raw and numeric format

In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_3_transform.sql` and run the **Analytics Views Setup** scripts.

```sql

### Step 2 - Run Through the Snowsight Worksheet Time Series Analysis Queries

### Set Session Context

Run the following three statements to ensure the worksheet session is in the right context.

```sql
-- Set role, context, and warehouse
USE ROLE ROLE_HOL_TIMESERIES;
USE SCHEMA HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS;
USE WAREHOUSE HOL_ANALYTICS_WH;
```

### Exploring Raw Time Series Data

We'll start with a simple **Raw** query that returns time series data between an input start time and end time.

**Raw**: Retrieve time series data between an input start time and end time.

```sql
/* RAW
Retrieve time series data between an input start time and end time.
*/
SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
AND TIMESTAMP < '2024-01-01 00:00:10'
AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

<img src="assets/analysis_query_rawleft.png" />

### Time Series Statistical Aggregates

The following set of queries contains various [Aggregate Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-aggregation) covering **counts, math operations, distributions, and watermarks**.

**Counts**: Retrieve count and distinct counts within the time boundary.

```sql
/* COUNT AND COUNT DISTINCT
Retrieve count and distinct counts within the time boundary.

COUNT - Count of all values
COUNT DISTINCT - Count of unique values

Note: Counts can work with both varchar and numeric data types.
*/
SELECT TAGNAME, TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ('2024-01-01 01:00:00') AS TIMESTAMP,
    COUNT(VALUE) AS COUNT_VALUE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT VALUE) AS COUNT_DISTINCT_VALUE

AND TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-01 01:00:00'
AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
GROUP BY TAGNAME
ORDER BY TAGNAME;
```

<img src="assets/analysis_query_aggcount.png" />

**Math Operations**: Retrieve statistical detail for the readings within the time boundary.

```sql
/* MIN/MAX/AVG/SUM
Retrieve statistical aggregates for the readings within the time boundary using math operations.

MIN - Minimum value
MAX - Maximum value
AVG - Average of values (mean)
SUM - Sum of values

Note: Aggregates can work with numerical data types.
*/

AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
GROUP BY TAGNAME
ORDER BY TAGNAME;
```

<img src="assets/analysis_query_aggminmaxavgsum.png" />

**Relative Frequency**: Consider the use case of **calculating the frequency and relative frequency** of each value within a specific time frame, to **determine how often the value occurs**.

Find the value that occurs most frequently within a time frame.

```sql
/* RELATIVE FREQUENCY
Consider the use case of calculating the frequency and relative frequency of each value
within a specific time frame, to determine how often the value occurs.

Find the value that occurs most frequently within a time frame.
*/
SELECT 
    TAGNAME,
    VALUE,
    COUNT(VALUE) AS FREQUENCY,
    COUNT(VALUE) / SUM(COUNT(VALUE)) OVER(PARTITION BY TAGNAME) AS RELATIVE_FREQUENCY

AND TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-01 01:00:00'
AND VALUE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY TAGNAME, VALUE
ORDER BY TAGNAME, FREQUENCY DESC;
```

**Relative Frequency**: Value 424 occurs most, with a frequency of 13 and a relative frequency of 21.6%.

### Time Series Analytics using Window Functions

[Window Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-analytic) enable aggregates to operate over groups of data, looking forward and backwards in the ordered data rows, and returning a single result for each group. More detail available in [Using Window Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/functions-window-using).

* The **OVER()** clause defines the group of rows used in the calculation.
* The **PARTITION BY** sub-clause allows us to divide that window into sub-windows.
* The **ORDER BY** clause can be used with ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending), and allows ordering of the partition sub-window rows.

**Lag and Lead**: Consider the use case where you need to analyze the **changes in the readings** of a specific IoT sensor **over a short period** (say 10 seconds) by examining the **current, previous, and next values** of the readings.

Access data in previous (LAG) or subsequent (LEAD) rows without having to join the table to itself.

```sql
/* WINDOW FUNCTIONS - LAG AND LEAD
Consider the use case where you need to analyze the changes in the readings of a specific IoT sensor
over a short period (say 10 seconds) by examining the current, previous, and next values of the readings.

Access data in previous (LAG) or subsequent (LEAD) rows without having to join the table to itself.

LEAD - Next time period value

ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

<img src="assets/analysis_query_windowlaglead.png" />

**First and Last Value**: Consider the use case of **change detection** where you want to **detect any sudden pressure changes** in comparison to initial and final values in a specific time frame.

For this you would use the **FIRST_VALUE** and **LAST_VALUE** window functions to retrieve the first and last values within the time boundary to perform such an analysis.

```sql

**Rows Between - Preceding and Following**: Consider the use case, where the data you have is **second by second** sensor readings, and you want to compute the **rolling 6 second average** of sensor readings over a specific time frame to **detect trends and patterns** in the data.

In cases where the data **doesn't have any gaps**, you can use **ROWS BETWEEN** window frames to perform these **rolling calculations**.

Create a rolling AVG for the five preceding and following rows, inclusive of the current row.

**Range Between - 1 MIN Rolling Average and Sum showing gap differences**: Create a rolling AVG and SUM for the time **INTERVAL** 1 minute preceding, inclusive of the current row. Assuming the preceding 12 rows would make up 1 minute of data.

```sql
SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE_NUMERIC AS VALUE,
    AVG(VALUE_NUMERIC) OVER (
        PARTITION BY TAGNAME ORDER BY TIMESTAMP
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1 MIN' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RANGE_AVG_1MIN,
    AVG(VALUE_NUMERIC) OVER (
        PARTITION BY TAGNAME ORDER BY TIMESTAMP
        ROWS BETWEEN 12 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS ROW_AVG_1MIN,
    SUM(VALUE_NUMERIC) OVER (
        PARTITION BY TAGNAME ORDER BY TIMESTAMP
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1 MIN' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RANGE_SUM_1MIN,
    SUM(VALUE_NUMERIC) OVER (
        PARTITION BY TAGNAME ORDER BY TIMESTAMP
        ROWS BETWEEN 12 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS ROW_SUM_1MIN
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
AND TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-01 01:00:00'
AND DATE_PART('SECOND', TIMESTAMP) NOT IN (20, 45, 55)
AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG101'
ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

**The first minute of data aligns for both RANGE BETWEEN and ROWS BETWEEN, however, after the first minute the rolling values will start to show variances due to the introduced time gaps**.

##### CHART: Rolling 1 MIN Average and Sum - showing differences between RANGE BETWEEN and ROWS BETWEEN

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select the `VALUE` column and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
3. Select `+ Add column` and select `RANGE_AVG_1MIN` and set Aggregation to `Max`.
4. Select `+ Add column` and select `ROW_AVG_1MIN` and set Aggregation to `Max`.

**The chart shows variances between the RANGE BETWEEN and ROWS BETWEEN occuring after the first minute**.

##### CHART: Rolling 5 MIN Average

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select the `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
3. Select `+ Add column` and select `RANGE_AVG_5MIN` and set Aggregation to `Max`.

**A rolling average could be useful in scenarios where you are trying to detect EXCEEDANCES in equipment operating limits over periods of time, such as a maximum pressure limit**.

<img src="assets/analysis_chart_range_5min.png" />

### Downsampling Time Series Data

Downsampling is used to **decrease the frequency of time samples**, such as from seconds to minutes, by placing time series data into fixed time intervals using aggregate operations on the existing values within each time interval.

**Time Binning - 5 min Aggregate**: Consider a use case where you want to obtain a broader view of a high frequency pressure gauge, by aggregating data into evenly spaced intervals to find trends over time.

Create a downsampled time series data set with 5 minute aggregates, showing the **START and END timestamp label** of each interval.

```sql
/* TIME BINNING - 5 min AGGREGATE with START and END label
Create a downsampled time series data set with 5 minute aggregates, showing the START and END timestamp label of each interval.

COUNT - Count of values within the time bin
SUM - Sum of values within the time bin
AVG - Average of values (mean) within the time bin
PERCENTILE_95 - 95% of values are less than this within the time bin
*/
SELECT TAGNAME,
    TIME_SLICE(TIMESTAMP, 5, 'MINUTE', 'START') AS START_TIMESTAMP,
    TIME_SLICE(TIMESTAMP, 5, 'MINUTE', 'END') AS END_TIMESTAMP,
    COUNT(*) AS COUNT_VALUE,
    SUM(VALUE_NUMERIC) AS SUM_VALUE,
    AVG(VALUE_NUMERIC) AS AVG_VALUE,
    APPROX_PERCENTILE(VALUE_NUMERIC, 0.95) AS PERCENTILE_95_VALUE
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
AND TIMESTAMP < '2024-01-01 01:00:00'
AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
GROUP BY TIME_SLICE(TIMESTAMP, 5, 'MINUTE', 'START'), TIME_SLICE(TIMESTAMP, 5, 'MINUTE', 'END'), TAGNAME
ORDER BY TAGNAME, START_TIMESTAMP;
```

**For a one second tag (3600 data points over an hour), the results will show in five minute intervals containing 300 data points each, along with aggregates for counts, sum, average, and 95th percentile values**.

<img src="assets/analysis_query_timebin.png" />


### Aligning Time Series Data

Often you will need to **align two data sets** that may have differing time frequencies. To do this you can utilize the **Time Series ASOF JOIN** to pair closely matching records based on timestamps.

**Joining Time Series Data with ASOF JOIN**: Consider the use case where you want to align a one second and five second pressure gauge to determine if there is a correlation.

Using the `ASOF JOIN`, join two data sets by applying a `MATCH_CONDITION` to pair closely aligned timestamps and values.

```sql
/* ASOF JOIN - Align a 1 second tag with a 5 second tag
Consider the use case where you want to align a one second and five second pressure gauge to determine if there is a correlation.

Using the `ASOF JOIN`, join two data sets by applying a `MATCH_CONDITION` to pair closely aligned timestamps and values.
*/
SELECT ONE_SEC.TAGNAME AS ONE_SEC_TAGNAME, ONE_SEC.TIMESTAMP AS ONE_SEC_TIMESTAMP, ONE_SEC.VALUE_NUMERIC AS ONE_SEC_VALUE, FIVE_SEC.VALUE_NUMERIC AS FIVE_SEC_VALUE, FIVE_SEC.TAGNAME AS FIVE_SEC_TAGNAME, FIVE_SEC.TIMESTAMP AS FIVE_SEC_TIMESTAMP
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS ONE_SEC
ASOF JOIN (
    -- 5 sec tag data
    SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE_NUMERIC
    FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
    WHERE TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG101'
    ) FIVE_SEC
MATCH_CONDITION(ONE_SEC.TIMESTAMP >= FIVE_SEC.TIMESTAMP)
WHERE ONE_SEC.TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
AND ONE_SEC.TIMESTAMP >= '2024-01-03 09:15:00'
AND ONE_SEC.TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-03 09:45:00'
ORDER BY ONE_SEC.TIMESTAMP;
```

<img src="assets/analysis_query_asof_align.png" />

##### CHART: Aligned Time Series Data

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data set the first Data column to `ONE_SEC_VALUE` with an Aggregation of `Max`.
3. Set the X-Axis to `ONE_SEC_TIMESTAMP` and a Bucketing of `Second`
3. Select `+ Add column` and select `FIVE_SEC_VALUE` and set Aggregation to `Max`.

**One sensor is showing a significant drop whilst the other is showing an increase to a peak at similar times, which could potentially be an anomaly**.

<img src="assets/analysis_chart_align.png" />

### Gap Filling

Time gap filling is the process of generating timestamps for a given start and end time boundary, and joining to a tag with less frequent timestamp values, and filling missing / gap timestamps with a prior value. This can also be referred to as **Upsampling or Forward Filling**.

**Gap Filling**: Generate timestamps given a start and end time boundary, and use ASOF JOIN to a tag dataset with less frequent values, to forward fill using last observed value carried forward (LOCF).

```sql
/* GAP FILLING - 1 SEC TIMESTAMPS WITH 5 SEC TAG
Generate timestamps given a start and end time boundary, and use ASOF JOIN
to a tag dataset with less frequent values, to forward fill using last observed value carried forward (LOCF).

1 - SET TIME_PERIODS - A variable passed into the query to determine the number of time stamps generated for gap filling.
2 - Run the LOCF query passing in the TIME_PERIODS to the generated calendar
*/
-- SET TIME_PERIODS IN SECONDS
SET TIME_PERIODS = (SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF('SECOND', '2024-01-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP_NTZ, '2024-01-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP_NTZ + INTERVAL '1 MINUTE'));

### Time Series Forecasting

**[Time-Series Forecasting](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/ml-functions/forecasting)** employs a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict future data by using historical time series data.

**Forecasting** is part of **[ML Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-ml-functions#time-series-functions) in Snowflake Cortex, Snowflake’s intelligent, fully-managed AI and ML service**.

**Forecasting**: Consider a use case where you want to **predict expected production output** based on a flow sensor. In this case, you could **generate a time series forecast** for a single tag looking forward one day for a flow sensor.

1. Create a forecast **training data set** from historical data.

```sql
/* FORECAST DATA - Training Data Set - /IOT/SENSOR/TAG401
A single tag of data for two weeks.

1 - Create a forecast training data set from historical data. This will use a temporary table.
*/
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TEMP_TS_TAG_TRAIN AS
SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE_NUMERIC AS VALUE
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401'
ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

2. Create a Time-Series [SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/classes/forecast/commands/create-forecast) model using the training data set.

```sql
/* FORECAST MODEL - Training Data Set - /IOT/SENSOR/TAG401
2 - Create a Time-Series SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST model using the training data set.

INPUT_DATA - The data set used for training the forecast model
SERIES_COLUMN - The column that splits multiple series of data, such as different TAGNAMES
TIMESTAMP_COLNAME - The column containing the Time Series times
TARGET_COLNAME - The column containing the target value

Training the Time Series Forecast model may take 2-3 minutes in this case.
*/
CREATE OR REPLACE SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST HOL_TIMESERIES_FORECAST(
    INPUT_DATA => SYSTEM$REFERENCE('TABLE', 'HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TEMP_TS_TAG_TRAIN'),
    SERIES_COLNAME => 'TAGNAME',
    TIMESTAMP_COLNAME => 'TIMESTAMP',
    TARGET_COLNAME => 'VALUE'
);
```

> aside negative
> 
> **Training the Time Series Forecast model** may take 2-3 minutes in this case. Indicative training times available at [Training on Multi-Series Data](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/ml-functions/forecasting#training-on-multi-series-data).
>

3. Test Forecasting model output for one day.

```sql
/* FORECAST MODEL OUTPUT - Forecast for 1 Day
3 - Test Forecasting model output for one day.

SERIES_VALUE - Defines the series being forecasted - for example the specific tag
FORECASTING_PERIODS - The number of periods being forecasted
*/
CALL HOL_TIMESERIES_FORECAST!FORECAST(SERIES_VALUE => TO_VARIANT('/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401'), FORECASTING_PERIODS => 1440);
```

4. Create a forecast analysis combining historical data with forecast data using [RESULT_SCAN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/result_scan).

```sql
/* FORECAST COMBINED - Combined ACTUAL and FORECAST data
4 - Create a forecast analysis combining historical data with forecast data.

UNION the historical ACTUAL data with the FORECAST data using RESULT_SCAN
*/
SELECT
    'ACTUAL' AS DATASET,
    TAGNAME,
    TIMESTAMP,
    VALUE,
    NULL AS FORECAST,
    NULL AS UPPER
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401'
AND TO_DATE(TIMESTAMP) = '2024-01-14'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'FORECAST' AS DATASET,
    SERIES AS TAGNAME,
    TS AS TIMESTAMP,
    NULL AS VALUE,
    FORECAST,
    UPPER_BOUND AS UPPER
FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(-1))
ORDER BY DATASET, TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

##### CHART: Time Series Forecast

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data set the first column to `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
3. Select the `TIMESTAMP` column and set the Bucketing to `Minute`.
4. Select `+ Add column` and select `FORECAST` and set Aggregation to `Max`.

**The chart will show a flow sensor with ACTUALS and FORECAST values**.

## Build Your Own Time Series Functions
Duration: 10

Now that you have a great understanding of running **Time Series Analysis**, we will now look at deploying time series [User Defined Table Functions (UDTF)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/udf-overview) that can query time series data in a re-usable manner. Table functions will accept a set of input parameters and perform operations on a data set, and return results in a table format.

<img src="assets/byo_functions.png" />

#### INFO: Time Series Query Profiles

The following query profiles will be covered in this section.

| **Query Type** | **Functions** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upsampling / Interpolation | Custom Interpolation Table Function | Time binning aggregations with interpolated values over time intervals. |
| Downsampling - LTTB | Custom Snowpark Downsampling Table Function | Downsampling to a set number of data points whilst retaining the shape and variability of the time series data. |


### Table Functions Deploy

In this section we'll deploy two types of Time Series [User-Defined Table Functions (UDTF)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/udf-overview) that will be used to **resample time series data**.

#### Function 1 - SQL - Interpolation / Upsampling Time Series Data

**Upsampling** is used to **increase the frequency** of time samples, such as from hours to minutes, by placing time series data into fixed time intervals using aggregate operations on the values within each time interval. Due to the frequency of samples being increased it has the effect of **creating new values if the interval is more frequent** than the data itself.

If the interval does not contain a value, it will be **interpolated from the surrounding aggregated data**.

#### Function 2 - Python - Downsampling Time Series Data

**Downsampling** is used to **decrease the frequency** of time samples, such as from seconds to minutes. For the downsampling table function, we will deploy the **Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB)** downsampling algorithm, which is part of the **[Snowpark Python](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/) - plotly-resampler** package.

The **LTTB** algorithm **reduces the number of visual data points in a time series data set, whilst retaining the shape and variability of the time series data**. It's useful for reducing large time series data sets for charting purposes where the consumer system may have reduced memory resources.


### Step 1 - Deploy Time Series Functions and Procedures

1. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_5_functions.sql`

2. Click the `Execute All Statements` button at the top right of the worksheet to **deploy all functions and procedures**.

<img src="assets/function_info_runall.png" />

#### INFO: Time Series Functions and Procedures

The following functions and procedures have been deployed.

> aside positive
> 
> #### INFO: SQL INTERPOLATE Table Function
>
> The **INTERPOLATE Table Function** is using the [ASOF JOIN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/asof-join) for each time interval to **look both backwards (LAST_VALUE) and forwards (NEXT_VALUE) in time**, to calculate the time and value difference at each time interval, which is then used to generate a smooth linear interpolated value.

> #### INFO: Python Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB) Function
>
> The **Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB) downsampling** function uses a [Vectorized Python UDTF](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-tabular-vectorized) with an LTTB handler built using the **[Snowpark Python](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-tabular-vectorized) - plotly-resampler** package. The **LTTB** algorithm **reduces the number of visual data points in a time series data set, whilst retaining the shape and variability of the time series data**.
>
> **LTTB** package is available in the [Anaconda Snowflake Snowpark for Python Channel](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/) via **plotly-resampler** and runs securely inside Snowflake warehouses when executed.
>
> The original code for LTTB is available at [Sveinn Steinarsson - GitHub](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample).

$$;
```


### Step 2 - Copy Worksheet Content To Snowsight Worksheet

**With the functions deployed, we can look at using them to query time series data**.

#### This section will be executed within a Snowflake Snowsight Worksheet

1. **Login to Snowflake**, and from the menu expand `Projects > Worksheets`

<img src="assets/analysis_worksheets.png" />

2. At the top right of the **Worksheets** screen, select `+ > SQL Worksheet`. This will open a new worksheet in Snowsight.

<img src="assets/analysis_newworksheet.png" />

3. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_6_function_queries.sql`

4. **Copy** the contents of the worksheet to **clipboard**, and paste it into the newly created **Worksheet in Snowsight**


### Step 3 - Query Time Series Data Using Deployed Functions and Procedures

### Set Session Context

Run the following three statements to ensure the worksheet session is in the right context.

```sql
-- Set role, context, and warehouse
USE ROLE ROLE_HOL_TIMESERIES;
USE SCHEMA HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS;
USE WAREHOUSE HOL_ANALYTICS_WH;
```

### Upsampling / Interpolation Query

Upsampling is used to **increase the frequency of time samples**.

The first set of queries use the **INTERPOLATE table functions and procedures**
to produce values for upsampling both **last observed values carried forward (LOCF)** and
**LINEAR interpolated smoothing** values between data points.

Call the interpolate table function to return both the **linear interpolated values and last observed value carried forward (LOCF)**.

```sql
-- Set role, context, and warehouse
USE ROLE ROLE_HOL_TIMESERIES;
USE SCHEMA HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS;
USE WAREHOUSE HOL_ANALYTICS_WH;

/* INTERPOLATE TABLE FUNCTION
Call the interpolate table function to return both the linear interpolated values and last observed value carried forward (LOCF).
*/
SELECT * FROM TABLE(HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.FUNCTION_TS_INTERPOLATE('/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401', '2024-01-01 12:10:00'::TIMESTAMP_NTZ, '2024-01-01 13:10:00'::TIMESTAMP_NTZ, 10, 362)) ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

<img src="assets/function_query_direct.png" />

##### CHART: Interpolation - Linear and LOCF

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select `TIMESTAMP` and set Bucketing to `Second`
3. Under Data select `LINEAR_VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
4. Select `+ Add column` and select `LOCF_VALUE` and set Aggregation to `Max`.

**The chart will display both LINEAR and LOCF for interpolated values between data points**.

<img src="assets/function_chart_linearlocf.png" />


### Interpolation - Last Observed Value Carried Forward (LOCF) Query

The **Interpolation Procedure** will accept a start time and end time, along with a bucket interval size in seconds.

It will then calculate the number of buckets within the time boundary, and call the Interpolate table function.

Call Interpolate Procedure with Taglist, Start Time, End Time, and Intervals, with `LOCF` Interpolate type.

```sql
/* INTERPOLATE PROCEDURE - LOCF
The Interpolation Procedure will accept a start time and end time, along with a bucket interval size in seconds.

It will then calculate the number of buckets within the time boundary, and call the Interpolate table function.

Call Interpolate Procedure with Taglist, Start Time, End Time, and Intervals, with `LOCF` Interpolate type.
*/
CALL HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.PROCEDURE_TS_INTERPOLATE(
    -- V_TAGLIST
    '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401',
    -- V_FROM_TIME
    '2024-01-01 12:10:00',
    -- V_TO_TIME
    '2024-01-01 13:10:00',
    -- V_INTERVAL
    10,
    -- V_INTERP_TYPE
    'LOCF'
);
```

##### CHART: Interpolation - LOCF

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.

**The chart will display a LOCF value where the prior value is interpolated between data points**.

<img src="assets/function_chart_locf.png" />


### Interpolation - Linear Query

Similar to the LOCF interpolation procedure call, this will create a **LINEAR Interpolation** table.

Call Interpolate Procedure with Taglist, Start Time, End Time, and Intervals, with `LINEAR` Interpolate type.

```sql
/* INTERPOLATE PROCEDURE - LINEAR
Similar to the LOCF interpolation procedure call, this will create a Linear Interpolation table.

Call Interpolate Procedure with Taglist, Start Time, End Time, and Intervals, with `LINEAR` Interpolate type.
*/
CALL HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.PROCEDURE_TS_INTERPOLATE(
    -- V_TAGLIST
    '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401',
    -- V_FROM_TIME
    '2024-01-01 12:10:00',
    -- V_TO_TIME
    '2024-01-01 13:10:00',
    -- V_INTERVAL
    10,
    -- V_INTERP_TYPE
    'LINEAR'
);
```

##### CHART: Interpolation - Linear

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.

**The chart will display a smoother LINEAR interpolated value between data points**.

<img src="assets/function_chart_linear.png" />


### LTTB Query

The **Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB)** algorithm is a time series downsampling algorithm that reduces the number of visual data points, whilst retaining the shape and variability of the time series data.

Starting with a **RAW** query we can see the **LTTB** function in action, where the function will **downsample two hours of data for a one second tag**, 7200 data points downsampled to 500 data points whilst keeping the shape and variability of the values.

**RAW Query**

```sql
/* RAW - 2 HOURS OF 1 SEC DATA
Source of downsample - 7200 data points
*/
SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE_NUMERIC as VALUE
FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
WHERE TIMESTAMP > '2024-01-09 21:00:00'
AND TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-09 23:00:00'
AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

##### CHART: RAW Query

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
3. Under Data select `TIMESTAMP` and set the Bucketing to `Second`. 

**7200 Data Points**

<img src="assets/function_chart_lttb_raw.png" />

**LTTB Query**

We can now pass the same data into the **LTTB table function** and request 500 data points to be returned.

```sql
/* LTTB - DOWNSAMPLE TO 500 DATA POINTS
We can now pass the same data into the LTTB table function and request 500 data points to be returned.

The DATA subquery sets up the data set, and this is cross joined with the LTTB table function,
with an input of TIMESTAMP, VALUE, and the downsample size of 500.
*/
SELECT DATA.TAGNAME, LTTB.TIMESTAMP::VARCHAR::TIMESTAMP_NTZ AS TIMESTAMP, LTTB.VALUE 
FROM (
    SELECT TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, VALUE_NUMERIC as VALUE
    FROM HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.TS_TAG_READINGS
    WHERE TIMESTAMP > '2024-01-09 21:00:00'
    AND TIMESTAMP <= '2024-01-09 23:00:00'
    AND TAGNAME = '/IOT/SENSOR/TAG301'
) AS DATA 
CROSS JOIN TABLE(HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS.FUNCTION_TS_LTTB(DATE_PART(EPOCH_NANOSECOND, DATA.TIMESTAMP), DATA.VALUE, 500) OVER (PARTITION BY DATA.TAGNAME ORDER BY DATA.TIMESTAMP)) AS LTTB
ORDER BY TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP;
```

##### CHART: LTTB Query

1. Select the `Chart` sub tab below the worksheet.
2. Under Data select `VALUE` and set the Aggregation to `Max`.
3. Under Data select `TIMESTAMP` and set the Bucketing to `Second`. 

**500 Data Points - The shape and variability of the values are retained, when compared to the 7200 data point RAW chart**.

## Build Your Time Series Application in Streamlit
Duration: 15

After completing the analysis of the time series data that was streamed into Snowflake, we are now ready to **deliver a Time Series Analytics application** for end users to easily consume time series data. For this purpose we are going to use a **Streamlit in Snowflake** application, deployed using **Snowflake CLI**.

<img src="assets/streamlit_overview.png" />

> aside positive
> 
> #### INFO: Streamlit
> **Streamlit** is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to **create web applications for machine learning, data analysis, and visualization**. **[Streamlit in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)** helps developers securely build, deploy, and share **Streamlit apps on Snowflake’s data cloud platform**, without moving data or application code to an external system.
>
>
> #### INFO: Snowflake CLI
>
> **[Snowflake CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/introduction/introduction)** is an open-source command-line tool designed for developers to **easily create, deploy, update, and view apps running on Snowflake**. We will use Snowflake CLI to deploy the **Time Series Streamlit application** to your Snowflake account.
>


### Step 1 - Setup Snowflake Stage for Streamlit Application

1. In **VS Code** open the worksheet `worksheets/hol_timeseries_7_streamlit.sql`

2. Run the Worksheet to **create a stage for the Streamlit** application

```sql
/*##### STREAMLIT SCRIPT #####*/

-- Set role, context, and warehouse
USE ROLE ROLE_HOL_TIMESERIES;
USE SCHEMA HOL_TIMESERIES.ANALYTICS;
USE WAREHOUSE HOL_ANALYTICS_WH;

-- Create a stage for Streamlit

> #### INFO: Pre-Built Streamlit Application
>
> A pre-built **Streamlit Application** has been provided as part of this lab. It is located in the `streamlit` **project** folder of the **GitHub Codespace VS Code** repository.
>

### Step 2 - Deploy Streamlit Application to Snowflake

In this step, we will now deploy the Streamlit application on the Snowflake account using **Snowflake CLI**.

In the **GitHub Codespace VS Code**:

1. Open `Menu > Terminal > New Terminal` - a new terminal window will now open

<img src="assets/labsetup_newterminal.png" />

2. Activate `hol-timeseries` python virtual environment by running `conda activate hol-timeseries`

```bash
conda activate hol-timeseries
```

<img src="assets/labsetup_condaactivate.png" />

<img src="assets/labsetup_condaactivated.png" />

3. **Copy and run** the following Snowflake CLI command **into the Terminal** to deploy the Streamlit application

```bash
snow --config-file=".snowflake/config.toml" streamlit deploy --replace --project "streamlit" --connection="hol-timeseries-streamlit"
```

> - **--replace** option ensures that the **existing application, if present, is overwritten**
> - **--project** option provides the **path where the Streamlit app project resides**
> - **--connection** option dictates **which connection section from the ".snowflake/config.toml"** file should be used for deployment
>


### Step 3 - Launch the Streamlit Application

Once the Streamlit application is successfully deployed, Snowflake CLI will display the message **"Streamlit successfully deployed and available"** and will provide the URL for the Streamlit application.

<img src="assets/streamlit_launch.png" />

1. Press **Command/Ctrl** and **click the URL** link to launch the Streamlit application in a new tab. Alternatively, copy and paste the URL into a new tab.

2. Select `Open` once prompted.

> aside positive
> 
> #### INFO: Launch Streamlit Apps inside Snowflake
>
> You can also launch **Streamlit Applications** from inside Snowflake by going to `Projects > Streamlit` and opening the `HOL_TIMESERIES_STREAMLIT` application.
>
> <img src="assets/streamlit_open_snowsight.png" />
>


### Step 4 - Understanding the Streamlit Application

The **Streamlit in Snowflake** application contains several **pages**, accessible via the left menu, that cover various Time Series queries.

#### Streamlit Pages

* **Raw** Time Series Data
* **Statistical Aggregate** Time Series Data
* **Time Binning / Downsampling** Time Series Data

<img src="assets/streamlit_video_summary.gif" />

#### Filtering Menu

Each page has a filtering menu to:
* Select one or more tags
* Change reporting time selection
* Set the sample size of chart visualizations
* Select various aggregations

<img src="assets/streamlit_video_menu.gif" />

#### Streamlit Features

At the bottom of each page there are options to:
* **Select** how much data is displayed in the table along with the order
* **Download as CSV** - To download the data in CSV file format
* **Supporting Detail** - Shows the queries being run
* **Refresh Mode** - Contains a toggle to enable auto refresh and see new data automatically

<img src="assets/streamlit_video_features.gif" />


### Step 5 - Set Streamlit Filters and Query Data

#### Initial IoT Data Loaded: 1-Jan-2024 to 14-Jan-2024

The initial data set **contains two weeks of data loaded for 1-Jan-2024 to 14-Jan-2024**. Let's query this using the Streamlit application.

Open the **Streamlit Application**:

1. Select the **TS Raw** page

2. From **Select Tag Name** choose the `/IOT/SENSOR/TAG101`

3. For **Start Date** select `1-Jan-2024`

4. For **Start Time** select `00:00`

5. For **End Date** select `1-Jan-2024`

6. For **End Time** select `04:00`

<img src="assets/streamlit_query_filter.png" />

> aside positive
> 
> **Streamlit** will automatically refresh the page after making filter selections.
>
> Review the chart and table detail.
>

**Data for 1-Jan-2024 should now display**

<img src="assets/streamlit_query_raw.png" />

7. Select the **TS Aggregates** page

    - The aggregates page will show high level statistical detail for the selected tag and time period.

8. Select the **TS Binning** page

    - The binning page shows a 1 minute downsampled average for the selected tag and time period.

9. Try changing the **Select Aggregation Method** to `MIN` 

    - This will now show the 1 minute minimums for the tag and time period.

10. Try changing the **Label Position** to `START`

    - The **Tag Data** table will now show the **Start** timestamp for each minute interval.

> aside positive
> 
> #### INFO: Tag Data Schema
>
> The **Tag Data detail tables** in the Streamlit Application have a **schema** that returns columns for **TAGNAME, TIMESTAMP, and VALUE**. This is to mimic an **API data contract** that will return a consistent schema structure of the data.
>
> If an **aggregation has been applied** to the Tag Data, the **TAGNAME will be updated** to reflect the aggregation and time interval of the data.
>
> <img src="assets/streamlit_tag_data.png" />
>


### Step 6 - Start a Continuous Simulated Stream

We can now **start a continuous stream of data into Snowflake**, similar to the initial streaming load, to simulate IoT device **data streaming in near real-time** to Snowflake.

<img src="assets/model_streamingclient.png" />

In the **GitHub Codespace VS Code**:

1. Open `Menu > Terminal > New Terminal` - a new terminal window will now open

<img src="assets/labsetup_newterminal.png" />

2. Change directory into to the **iotstream** folder: `cd iotstream`

```bash
cd iotstream
```

3. Run the `Run_Slooow.sh` script to load the IoT data.

```bash
./Run_Slooow.sh
```

> aside positive
> 
> If there are no errors, IoT data will now be **streaming into Snowflake**, and the **Dynamic Tables** will start to update.
>

4. Back **in the Streamlit application** try enabling `Auto Refresh` by `Expanding Refresh Mode > Toggle Auto Refresh`

    - The charts and data should now start to **automatically update with new data streaming into Snowflake every minute**.

<img src="assets/streamlit_refresh.png" />

5. Select the **TS Raw** page to see the raw data

6. Try adding `/IOT/SENSOR/TAG401` and `/IOT/SENSOR/TAG601` to the **Select Tag Names** filter

    - The charts and data should now contain two additional tags with the data updating every minute.

<img src="assets/streamlit_query_stream.png" />

> aside positive
> 
> You have now successfully deployed a **Time Series Application** using Streamlit in Snowflake. This will allow end users easy access to visualize time series data as well as run their own **Time Series Analysis** on all Time Series data available in Snowflake.
