# Build a CineBot with Snowflake Native Apps and Snowflake Cortex
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 1

The Snowflake Native App Framework is a powerful way for application providers to build, deploy and market applications via the Snowflake Marketplace.  In this example you will learn how to incorporate Snowflake's Cortex Suite into a Native App that will create a 'CineBot' that can recommend Movies. 

### Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- Familiarity with Snowflake Snowsight Interface
- Ability to install and run software on your computer
- Basic experience using git

### What You’ll Learn 
- How to create an app using the Snowflake Native App framework
- How to utilize the Snowflake Cortex Suite and integrate it into a Native App
- How to test the Snowflake Native App Provider and Consumer experience within a single Snowflake account

### What You’ll Need 
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed
- A [Snowflake Account](https://signup.snowflake.com/)


### What You’ll Build 
- A Snowflake Native App that utilizes the Snowflake Cortex Search and Complete capabilities to create a movie recommendation service aka a 'CineBot'. You'll set up an Snowflake account to operate as a Provider and Consumer environment, load data from an S3 bucket into a table and build out the Snowflake Native App.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Snowflake Application Code
Duration: 5
### Overview
In preparation for building our Snowflake Native App we need to download the code artifacts for the Native App.

### Clone or Download Github Repo
The code for the Native App is on Github. Start by cloning or downloading the repository into a separate folder. 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-chatbot-with-snowflake-native-app-snowflake-cortex.git
```
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Native App Provider Setup 
Duration: 5
### Overview
To simulate a Native App provider experience we will create a role called 'nactx_role' and grant it the necessary privileges required to create an [Application Package](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/creating-app-package) as well as create a database that will store our app code.  

### Create NACTX role and Grant Privileges
```sql
use role accountadmin;
create role if not exists nactx_role;
grant role nactx_role to role accountadmin;
grant create warehouse on account to role nactx_role;
grant create database on account to role nactx_role;
grant create application package on account to role nactx_role;
grant create application on account to role nactx_role with grant option;
```

### Create CORTEX_APP Database to Store Application Files 
```sql
use role nactx_role;
create database if not exists cortex_app;
create schema if not exists cortex_app.napp;
create stage if not exists cortex_app.napp.app_stage;
create warehouse if not exists wh_nap with warehouse_size='xsmall';
```
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Native App Consumer Setup 
Duration: 5
### Overview
To simulate the app consumer experience we will create a role called 'nac' and grant it the necessary privileges required to create Applications as well as set up a database to house the data we'll be querying with our Snowflake Native App.  

### Create NAC role and Grant Privileges
```sql
use role accountadmin;
create role if not exists nac;
grant role nac to role accountadmin;
grant create warehouse on account to role nac;
grant create database on account to role nac;
grant create application on account to role nac;
```

### Create Consumer Test Data Database and Load Data
```sql
use role nac;
create warehouse if not exists wh_nac with warehouse_size='medium';
create database if not exists movies;
create schema if not exists movies.data;
use schema movies.data;

CREATE STAGE MOVIES.DATA.MY_STAGE
URL='s3://sfquickstarts/vhol_build_2024_native_app_cortex_search/movies_metadata.csv'
DIRECTORY = (
ENABLE = true
AUTO_REFRESH = true
);

CREATE FILE FORMAT MOVIES.DATA.CSV_FILE_FORMAT
	TYPE=CSV
    SKIP_HEADER=1
    FIELD_DELIMITER=','
    TRIM_SPACE=TRUE
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"'
    REPLACE_INVALID_CHARACTERS=TRUE
    DATE_FORMAT=AUTO
    TIME_FORMAT=AUTO
    TIMESTAMP_FORMAT=AUTO; 

CREATE TABLE movies.data.movies_metadata (
    adult BOOLEAN,
    belongs_to_collection VARCHAR,
    budget NUMBER(38, 0),
    genres VARCHAR,
    homepage VARCHAR,
    id NUMBER(38, 0),
    imdb_id VARCHAR,
    original_language VARCHAR,
    original_title VARCHAR,
    overview VARCHAR,
    popularity VARCHAR,
    poster_path VARCHAR,
    production_companies VARCHAR,
    production_countries VARCHAR,
    release_date DATE,
    revenue NUMBER(38, 0),
    runtime NUMBER(38, 1),
    spoken_languages VARCHAR,
    status VARCHAR,
    tagline VARCHAR,
    title VARCHAR,
    video BOOLEAN,
    vote_average NUMBER(38, 1),
    vote_count NUMBER(38, 0)
);

COPY INTO MOVIES.DATA.MOVIES_METADATA
FROM  @my_stage FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = CSV_FILE_FORMAT) ON_ERROR = CONTINUE;

create or replace table movies_raw as 
select title, budget::string as budget, overview, popularity, release_date::string as release_date, 
runtime::string as runtime 
from movies.data.movies_metadata;
```

## Create Application Package
Duration: 5 
### Overview
With all of our Snowflake Native App assets uploaded to our Snowflake account we can now create our Application Package using our Provider role.  Since we're doing this in a single Snowflake account we will also grant the Consumer role privileges to install it. 

### Create Application Package and Grant Consumer Role Privileges
```sql
use role nactx_role;
create application package cortex_app_pkg;
```

### Upload Native App Code
After creating the application package we'll need to upload the Native App code to the the **CORTEX_APP.NAPP.APP_STAGE** stage.  This can be accomplished by navigating to this stage using Snowsight - click on the 'Database' icon on the left side navigation bar and then on the **CORTEX_APP database > NAPP schema > APP_STAGE stage**.  You will need to do the following: 
1. Click on 'Select Warehouse' and choose 'WH_NAP' for the Warehouse 
2. Click on the '+ Files' button in the top right corner 
3. Browse to the location where you cloned or downloaded the Github repo and into the '/app/' folder
4. Select all 3 files (setup.sql, manifest.yml, readme.md) 
5. Click the 'Upload' button
6. Browse back up one level and then go into the '/src/' folder
7. Select both files (ui.py, environment.yaml)
8. Click the 'Upload' button

When this is done succesfully your we're now ready to create the Application Package. 

### Alter the Application Package
```sql
alter application package cortex_app_pkg add version v1 using @cortex_app.napp.app_stage;
grant install, develop on application package cortex_app_pkg to role nac;
```

## Install & Run Application
Duration: 5
### Overview
To simulate the app consumer experience we will create a role called 'nac' and grant it the necessary privileges required to create Applications as well as set up a database to house the data we'll be querying with our Snowflake Native App.  

### Install App as the Consumer
```sql
use role nac;
create application cortex_app_instance from application package cortex_app_pkg using version v1;
```
### Grant the Application Privileges on the Movies Table
```sql
grant all on database movies to application cortex_app_instance;
grant all on schema movies.data to application cortex_app_instance;
grant all on table movies.data.movies_raw to application cortex_app_instance;
grant usage on warehouse wh_nac to application cortex_app_instance;
```
### Grant the Application IMPORTED PRIVILEGES which allows it to use Cortex Functions
```sql
--This is a special step required to allow Native Apps to utilized Cortex Functions in a consumer database 
use role accountadmin;
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION cortex_app_instance;
```
### Call the supplied Stored Procedures to process the movies data and build the Cortex Search Service
```sql
use role nac;
call CORTEX_APP_INSTANCE.CORE.TABLE_CHUNKER();
call CORTEX_APP_INSTANCE.CORE.CREATE_CORTEX_SEARCH();
```

At this point you can navigate the the Application by clicking on **'Data Products'** on the left side of the Snowsight screen and then by clicking on **'Apps'**.  You can click on the **Cortext_App_Instance** application and it will bring up the chatbot where you can ask it to recommend movies.   

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Cleanup 
Duration: 2
### Overview

To clean up your environment you can run the following series of commands.
### Clean Up
```sql
--clean up consumer objects
use role NAC;
drop application cortex_app_instance cascade;
drop warehouse wh_nac;
drop database movies;

--clean up provider objects
use role nactx_role;
drop application package cortex_app_pkg;
drop database cortex_app;
drop warehouse wh_nap;

--clean up prep objects
use role accountadmin;
drop role nactx_role;
drop role nac;
```
