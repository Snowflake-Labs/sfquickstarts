## Summary
In the world of data, modeling can take on many forms. In this webinar, Serge Gershkovich, database architect and Snowflake data superhero, will demystify modeling by taking the users through every step of the design process. 

## We will learn: 
How to use modeling to make sense of an unfamiliar database landscape
Create new dimensions using the bus matrix
Go from conceptual to physical modeling
Use dbt to go from physical to transformational modeling 
Transition from modeling to mapping to maintain a holistic view of our database

The examples in this session will demonstrate how “obvious” things can seem once a certain level of familiarity has been established. But we must not lose sight of how difficult the problem was initially - which is exactly how difficult others will find it when they approach it with fresh eyes. Modeling, in all its forms, is the process that can capture the familiarity that one person has attained and make it accessible to everyone else. 


## Quotes
You tend to overestimate the final result if you already know the answer. You also tend to **underestimate** the difficulty of the question or the problem.

Before there is data, there can be no transformation, but that doesn’t mean there is no modeling. 

Once you’ve done the work, make sure that the information is not lost as you transition between tools. 

The best time to document is during the development phase, while the functional and technical knowledge is still fresh in your mind.
