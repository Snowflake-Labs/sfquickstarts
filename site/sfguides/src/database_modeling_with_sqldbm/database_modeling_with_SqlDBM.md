# Cloud-native Database Modeling with SqlDBM 
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

Relational database modeling enables instant visual review of a database landscape and the relationships between its entities - like a map for your data. 

[SqlDBM](https://www.SqlDBM.com) is an online database modeling tool that works with leading cloud platforms such as Snowflake, and requires absolutely no coding to get started. In this Quickstart, you will see how you can model your entire Snowflake database in just a few clicks and begin taking advantage of all the time-saving features that SqlDBM delivers. 

### What youâ€™ll learn 
* How to quickly diagram an existing schema through reverse engineering
* Create and manipulate database objects using time-saving features like copying and cloning
* The importance of primary and foreign key relationships and how to declare them 
* Inheritance for parent/child objects 
* Forward engineering & deployment of changes to Snowflake

### What You'll Use During the Lab

* An existing or trial [Snowflake account](https://trial.snowflake.com/) with `ACCOUNTADMIN` access

* An existing or trial [SqlDBM account](https://sqldbm.com/Home/)  


### What You'll Build
* A relational model of an entire database schema
* Add new tables with no coding required
* Relate the tables through primary and foreign key constraints
* A data catalog with column-level descriptions

### What is Database Modeling?
An entity-relationship (ER) diagram is the traditional way of visualizing the tables and their relationships in a relational database. Having a diagram not only makes it easier to find relevant tables, but also gives the user an instantaneous idea of how tables can be joined to one another for analytics purposes. 

SqlDBM takes the ER diagram's visual, no-code approach, and allows user to manipulate their database directly using the graphical perspective. Instead of writing DDL by hand, SqlDBM users can drag, drop, copy, and clone objects using an intuitive, browser-based graphical interface. Then, we take it a step further!

With SqlDBM, changes made on a diagram can be forward-engineered into neat, Snowflake-specific DDL and deployed back to the database. What's more, the tool leverages this intuitive, code-free approach to enable collaboration, documentation, and version control. 

We'll go through all these features in detail as part of this quickstart, so let's get started by setting up our account.

3. Ensure that your user has the following grants assigned in order to follow along with the quickstart. If not, sample DDL will be provided where needed. 


Privilege | Required for | Alternative
---------|----------|---------
 USAGE on SCHEMA | Bringing existing database into a SqlDBM project | Use sample DDL provided
 ALL on schema | Deploying changes back into Snowflake | N/A
