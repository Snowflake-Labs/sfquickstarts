## Identifying Policies
Duration: 10

**Overview**

In today's world of data management, it is common to have policies and procedures that range from data quality and retention to personal data protection. If you are an organization that has policies defined, how difficult is it to find them? Often, policies are in file shares or document systems, making them very hard to discover. With Alation, you can store your policies where your data assets live, which makes them extremely easy to find. The other huge benefit is that data assets associated with the policy can be tracked.

![VHOL-Screen5](./assets/Screen4-Policies.png)
![VHOL-Border4](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

1. Policies are part of the Governance App. Click on the dropdown arrow next to Apps.
2. Click on the Govern icon.

![VHOL-Screen6](./assets/Screen4-Policies-Exer1.png)

3. Click on the Policy Center tile.

![VHOL-Screen7](./assets/Screen4-Policies-Exer2.png)

4. Once in Policy Center, you will be able to complete the exercise as outlined.

![VHOL-Screen8](./assets/Screen4-Policies-Exer3.png)

![VHOL-Border5](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Policies as living content centralized with data asset information helps everyone in the organization. 

Now it is time to move on to Search and Discovery!

![VHOL-Screen9](./assets/Screen4-Policies-bottom.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Search & Discovery
Duration: 10

**Overview**

Every organization wants to make data-driven decisions. For this to become a reality, all employees must have the ability to quickly search data assets (databases, files, reports, etc.) to discover trusted data they can understand and use. 

Alation creates an experience that allows users to expand their world of knowledge through curation and collaboration. A community of technical and non-technical producers and consumers helps drive data literacy, leading to better business decisions and success.

![VHOL-Screen10](./assets/Screen5-Search.png)

![VHOL-Border6](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

1. The Alation Search bar is always present on the home page in the header and at the top of the other pages.

![VHOL-Screen11](./assets/Screen5-Search-Exer1.png)

2. As you start to type what you want to search for, Alation provides suggestions.
3. Click on All Results to see what the search has found and to filter the results to find what you are looking for quickly.

![VHOL-Screen12](./assets/Screen5-Search-Exer2.png)

4. The top filters let you narrow your search by object type like column, articles, terms, etc.
5. The left-hand side of the screen has additional filters based on tags, custom fields, and more. This is a compelling way to look for specific items like PII Data Classification.
6. Search provides the trust flags to tell if the result item has been endorsed, warned, or deprecated. The star indicates this is an item you marked as one of your favorites.

![VHOL-Screen13](./assets/Screen5-Search-Exer3.png)

![VHOL-Border7](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Search is core to increasing productivity and data literacy. Spend minutes instead of days finding the data that you need.

Now it is time to move on to Compose, Alation's SQL editor!

![VHOL-Screen14](./assets/Screen5-Search-bottom.png)
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Compose 
Duration: 15

**Overview**

In addition to the rich cataloging and governance capabilities, Alation enables users to interact with data stored in cataloged sources. This capability is called Compose and provides a fully integrated and governed SQL development environment. 

Compose is more than your typical SQL editor. Because it is integrated with the catalog, the editor's IntelliSense can provide suggestions as you type for tables, columns, joins, etc. Another advantage is that active governance will show you when an item is deprecated, so you are not using bad data.

Queries can be developed by those who know SQL and shared with others in the organization. No worries if you don’t know how to read or write SQL. Queries can be published as forms that allow the business user to fill out some prompts and get answers to the questions they need to be answered.

![VHOL-Screen15](./assets/Screen6-Compose.png)

![VHOL-Border8](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Queries and Compose are accessible from several places in the application. The following shows how you can navigate to them.

1. When viewing a table, you can click on the Queries tab to see all of the queries associated with this table.
2. The Compose link is in the upper right of the table view page. 

![VHOL-Screen16](./assets/Screen6-Compose-Exer1.png)

3. The left-hand navigation provides a Queries selection that can be expanded to see current queries.
4. You can click on the arrow to see additional queries and filters.
5. You can click on this link to launch the Compose SQL editor application, which will appear in a new tab.

![VHOL-Screen17](./assets/Screen6-Compose-Exer2.png)

6. Since Compose was launched from a table view, a select statement with that table appears. If you were coming to Compose from a query, the query would appear.
7. The Connection Settings is where you provide your credentials to connect to the Alation provided Demo Sample Data - data source.

![VHOL-Screen18](./assets/Screen6-Compose-Exer3.png)

![VHOL-Border9](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Compose helps spread data literacy in the organization by allowing users to build and share queries that help answer business questions.

Now it is time to wrap this up; let’s finish with a quick summary!

![VHOL-Screen19](./assets/Screen6-Compose-bottom.png)
