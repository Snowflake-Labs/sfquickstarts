## Identifying Policies
Duration: 10

**Overview**

In today's world of data management, it is common to have policies and procedures that range from data quality and retention to personal data protection. If you are an organization that has policies defined, how difficult is it to find them? Often, policies are in file shares or document systems, making them very hard to discover. With Alation, you can store your policies where your data assets live, which makes them extremely easy to find. The other huge benefit is that data assets associated with the policy can be tracked.

![VHOL-Screen8](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen1.png)
![VHOL-Screen9](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen2.png)
![VHOL-Border4](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

1. Policies are part of Alation Data Governance which also includes Stewardship Workbench, and Workflow. Duplicate your current brower tab, then click on Policies in the left-hand navigation.

![VHOL-Screen10](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen3.png)

2. Click on the Personal Data Handling policy group.

![VHOL-Screen11](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen4.png)

3. From the list of policies in the group, select the Personal Data Protection Policy.
4. Use your browser back arrow to return to the Personal Data Handling policy group. From the list of policies in the group, select the CUST_NAME_MASK policy.

![VHOL-Screen12](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen5.png)

![VHOL-Border5](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Policies as living content centralized with data asset information helps everyone in the organization.  They consist of both business and data policies.

Now it is time to move on to Search and Discovery!

![VHOL-Screen13](./assets/Section6-Policies-Screen6.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Search & Discovery
Duration: 10

**Overview**

Every organization wants to make data-driven decisions. For this to become a reality, all employees must have the ability to quickly search data assets (databases, files, reports, etc.) to discover trusted data they can understand and use. 

Alation creates an experience that allows users to expand their world of knowledge through curation and collaboration. A community of technical and non-technical producers and consumers helps drive data literacy, leading to better business decisions and success.

![VHOL-Screen14](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen1.png)
![VHOL-Screen15](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen2.png)

![VHOL-Border6](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

1. The Alation Search bar is always present on the home page in the header and at the top of the other pages.

![VHOL-Screen16](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen3.png)

2. As you start to type what you want to search for, Alation provides suggestions.
3. Click on **See all results** to see what the search has found and to filter the results to find what you are looking for quickly.

![VHOL-Screen17](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen4.png)

4. Filters are displayed on the left panel on the search results page. You can narrow your search by object type, such as table, column, BI reports, terms, tags, custom fields, etc. Some object types have subtypes. To see the subtypes, click the arrow next to the subject area and select the desired items from the list.

![VHOL-Screen18](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen5.png)

5. After you set the filters, they will be displayed as Applied Filters, and the application will refresh the search results.

6. Search provides the trust flags to tell if the result item has been endorsed, has informational messages, or has been deprecated, along with an indicator showing if the item has been bookmarked.

![VHOL-Screen19](./assets/Section7-Search-Screen6.png)

![VHOL-Border7](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Search is core to increasing productivity and data literacy. Spend minutes instead of days finding the data that you need.

Now it is time to move on to Compose, Alation's SQL editor!

![VHOL-Screen20](./assets/Section7-Search-screen7.png)
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Compose 
Duration: 10

**Overview**

In addition to the rich cataloging and governance capabilities, the Alation Data Intelligence Platform enables users to interact with data stored in cataloged sources. This capability is called Compose and provides a fully integrated and governed SQL development environment.

Compose is more than your typical SQL editor. Because it is integrated with the active metadata stored in the catalog, the editor's IntelliSense can provide suggestions as you type for tables, columns, joins, etc. Another advantage is that active data governance will show you when an item is deprecated, so you are not using bad data.

Queries can be developed by those who know SQL and shared with others in the organization. No worries if you don't know how to read or write SQL. Queries can be published as forms, allowing the business user to fill out some prompts and get answers to the questions they need answered.

![VHOL-Screen21](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen1.png)
![VHOL-Screen22](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen2.png)

![VHOL-Border8](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/lightbulb.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Exercise Guidance</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Queries and Compose are accessible from several places in the application. The following shows how you can navigate to them.

1. When viewing a table, **Open with Compose** will open Compose with a new query on this table.
2. You can click the Queries tab to see all the queries associated with this table.
3. Next to each query is an **Open in Compose** button that will open Compose with that query.

![VHOL-Screen23](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen3.png)

4. Another way to find queries is to use the left-hand navigation that provides a Queries selection to launch a search filtered for just queries.

![VHOL-Screen24](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen4.png)

5. In the example below, a select statement with that table appears since Compose was launched with Open with Compose from a table view.
6. The Connection Settings is where you provide your credentials to connect to the Alation provided Demo Sample Data - data source.

![VHOL-Screen25](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen5.png)
![VHOL-Border9](./assets/BorderLine.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Compose helps spread data literacy in the organization by allowing users to build and share queries that help answer business questions.

Now it is time to move onto Data Quality!

![VHOL-Screen26](./assets/Section8-Compose-Screen6.png)
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Quality
Duration: 5

**Overview**

Data quality is a critical data management function that helps identify issues based on the rules defined and executed against the data. Thresholds can be set to help guide users on whether using the data is appropriate or not. 

Alation provides extensive data quality capabilities through its Open Data Quality Framework. Snowflake provides data quality features through Data Metric Functions (DMFs). The two integrated provide people with the health of the data at the point of consumption. Additional data quality policies provide the details of the data quality rule, thresholds for good, warning, and alert conditions, the data assets processed by the rule, and more.

When the stakes are high, especially when providing data for AI models, data quality is a must!

![VHOL-Screen36](./assets/Section9-Quality-Screen10.png)

<table>   
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"> </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/blackcheckmark.png" width="30" height="25"/></td>
            <td><b>Benefits</b></td>
        </tr>
