# Deploy Fleet Intelligence Solution for Taxis

> 🚖 **Track. Analyze. Optimize.** Build a real-time taxi fleet control center with AI-powered insights - powered by OpenRouteService in Snowflake.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

![Fleet Intelligence Control Center](assets/control-center.png)

**Build a fully interactive Fleet Intelligence Control Center using the OpenRouteService Native App.**

This quickstart deploys a multi-page Streamlit application that simulates a taxi fleet operations dashboard. Track individual drivers, visualize routes in real-time, and analyze fleet density with interactive heat maps - all powered by Snowflake's geospatial capabilities.

### What You'll Build

🚖 **Fleet Intelligence Control Center** - A multi-page Streamlit dashboard that:
- Tracks individual driver journeys with route visualization
- Provides AI-powered trip analysis using Snowflake Cortex
- Displays fleet density heat maps with H3 hexagon visualization
- Shows driver performance metrics including speed and distance analytics

📊 **Fleet Analytics** - Real-time insights including:
- Driver route tracking with pickup/dropoff locations
- Time-based filtering to analyze trips by hour
- Speed distribution analysis across the fleet
- Interactive maps with pydeck visualization

### Prerequisites

> **_IMPORTANT:_** This demo requires the **OpenRouteService Native App** to be installed and running. If you haven't installed it yet, complete the [Install OpenRouteService Native App](../oss-install-openrouteservice-native-app/) quickstart first.

**Required:**
- OpenRouteService Native App deployed and activated
- Cortex Code CLI installed and configured
- Active Snowflake connection with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- Overture Maps Places and Addresses datasets from Snowflake Marketplace

### What You'll Learn 

- Deploy fleet analytics dashboards using Cortex Code skills
- Work with **Carto Overture Maps** datasets for realistic location data
- Use **Snowflake Cortex AI** to generate sample addresses
- Build multi-layer geospatial visualizations with Pydeck
- Create H3 hexagon heat maps for density analysis
- Track driver states (waiting, pickup, driving, dropoff, idle)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploy the Fleet Intelligence Solution

Use Cortex Code to deploy the Fleet Intelligence solution including database setup, data generation, and the Streamlit dashboard.

### Run the Deploy Skill

In the Cortex Code CLI, type:

```
use the local skill from oss-deploy-a-fleet-intelligence-solution-for-taxis/skills/deploy-fleet-intelligence
```

> **_NOTE:_** The skill will first verify that the OpenRouteService Native App is installed. If it's not found, it will provide instructions to install it first.

The skill uses interactive prompting to gather required information:

- **Number of drivers**: 20 to 500+ (default: 80)
- **Number of days**: 1 to 30+ (default: 1)
- **City**: San Francisco (default), New York, London, or Paris

Cortex Code will automatically:
- **Verify** OpenRouteService Native App is installed and running
- **Acquire Marketplace Data** - Gets Carto Overture Maps Places and Addresses
- **Create Database** - Sets up `FLEET_INTELLIGENCE` with required schemas
- **Generate Sample Data** - Creates drivers, trips, and routes using ORS
- **Deploy Dashboard** - Creates the Fleet Intelligence Control Center Streamlit app

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Understanding the Data Model

### Driver States

The simulation tracks realistic driver states throughout each trip:

| Point Index | State | Speed | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | waiting | 0 km/h | Waiting for fare (2-8 min before trip) |
| 1 | pickup | 0 km/h | Passenger boarding |
| 2-12 | driving | Variable | En route with traffic simulation |
| 13 | dropoff | 0-3 km/h | Slowing for passenger exit |
| 14 | idle | 0 km/h | Brief idle after dropoff |

### Speed Distribution

Realistic traffic patterns are simulated:

| Speed Band | Percentage | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| 0 km/h (Stationary) | ~23% | Waiting, pickup, dropoff, idle |
| 1-5 km/h (Crawling) | ~11% | Traffic jams, red lights |
| 6-15 km/h (Slow) | ~14% | Heavy traffic |
| 16-30 km/h (Moderate) | ~26% | Normal city driving |
| 31-45 km/h (Normal) | ~20% | Clear roads |
| 46+ km/h (Fast) | ~6% | Late night, highways |

### Shift Patterns

Drivers are distributed across 5 shifts for 24-hour coverage:

| Shift | Hours | % of Fleet | Coverage |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| Graveyard | 22:00-06:00 | 10% | Overnight |
| Early | 04:00-12:00 | 22.5% | Morning rush start |
| Morning | 06:00-14:00 | 27.5% | Full morning rush |
| Day | 11:00-19:00 | 22.5% | Midday + evening start |
| Evening | 15:00-23:00 | 17.5% | Evening rush |

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Customize the Solution

### Change Number of Drivers

Edit the driver count in the shift patterns:

```sql
-- Default: 80 drivers total
SELECT 1 AS shift_id, 'Graveyard' AS shift_name, 22 AS shift_start, 6 AS shift_end, 8 AS driver_count UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 'Early', 4, 12, 18 UNION ALL
SELECT 3, 'Morning', 6, 14, 22 UNION ALL
SELECT 4, 'Day', 11, 19, 18 UNION ALL
SELECT 5, 'Evening', 15, 23, 14
```

### Change City

The solution supports multiple cities. Change the bounding box in the data generation:

| City | Longitude Range | Latitude Range |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| San Francisco | -122.52 to -122.35 | 37.70 to 37.82 |
| New York City | -74.05 to -73.90 | 40.65 to 40.85 |
| London | -0.20 to 0.05 | 51.45 to 51.55 |
| Paris | 2.25 to 2.42 | 48.82 to 48.90 |

> **_NOTE:_** When changing cities, ensure your OpenRouteService Native App has the corresponding map data installed. See the [Install OpenRouteService Native App](../oss-install-openrouteservice-native-app/) quickstart for location customization.

### Scaling Recommendations

| Drivers | Days | Est. Rows | Warehouse | Est. Time |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 20 | 1 | ~4K | SMALL | 2-3 min |
| 80 | 1 | ~18K | MEDIUM | 5-8 min |
| 80 | 7 | ~125K | LARGE | 20-30 min |
| 200 | 1 | ~45K | LARGE | 15-20 min |
| 200 | 7 | ~315K | XLARGE | 45-60 min |
| 500 | 7 | ~800K | XLARGE | 2-3 hours |
