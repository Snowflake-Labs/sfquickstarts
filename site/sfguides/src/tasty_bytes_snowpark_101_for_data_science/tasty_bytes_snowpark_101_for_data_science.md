<img src="assets/tasty_bytes_header.png"/>

In this Snowpark 101 for Data Science Quickstart guide, you will be help the fictitious food truck company, Tasty Bytes, to increase sales by training a model to provide location recommendations to truck drivers. You will use **Snowpark for Python** to prepare data, train a model, and deploy the model. Once deployed, you will create an application prototype using **Streamlit** to demonstrate how truck drivers could use the model to find the best location to park for an upcoming shift.

### What is Snowpark?
Snowpark allows developers to query and create data applications in Python, Java, and Scala through APIs and DataFrame-style programming constructs that run on Snowflake's elastic engine. Learn more about [Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index).

### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit *(acquired by Snowflake in March 2022)* is a Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps. Learn more about [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

### What You Will Learn 
- How to access third-party data from the **Snowflake Data Marketplace**
- How to explore data & perform **feature engineering with Snowpark DataFrame APIs**
- How to **train a model in Snowflake** with a stored procedure
- How to **deploy a model in Snowflake** to a user-defined function for model inference
- How to **build a Streamlit app** to interact with the model

## Setting up the Data in Snowflake
Duration: 6

### Overview
You will use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#), the Snowflake web interface, to:
- Access SafeGraph location data from the Snowflake Marketplace
- Create Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema)
- Ingest shift sales data from S3
- Join shift sales with the SafeGraph location data

Tasty Bytes operates food trucks in cities across the globe with each truck having the ability to choose two different selling locations per day. The locations are mapped to SafeGraph points-of-interest. You want to join latitude and longitude from the SafeGraph Marketplace data to your shift sales data to use as features in model training.

### Step 1 - Acquiring SafeGraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace 
- Log into your Snowflake account.
- Follow the steps and video below to access the SafeGraph Marketplace listing in your Snowflake account.

  - Click -> Home Icon
  - Click -> Marketplace
  - Search -> frostbyte
  - Click -> SafeGraph: frostbyte
  - Click -> Get
  - Rename Database -> FROSTBYTE_SAFEGRAPH (all capital letters)
  - Grant to Additional Roles -> PUBLIC

USE WAREHOUSE tasty_dsci_wh;

-- ingest from S3 into the shift sales table
COPY INTO frostbyte_tasty_bytes_dev.raw.shift_sales
FROM @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_dev.raw.s3load/analytics/shift_sales/;

-- join in SafeGraph data
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_dev.harmonized.shift_sales
  AS
SELECT
    a.location_id,
    a.city,
    a.date,
    a.shift_sales,
    a.shift,
    a.month,
    a.day_of_week,
    a.city_population,

## Application Prototype with Streamlit
Duration: 6

### Overview
Now that you have deployed a model that predicts the shift sales of each location for the upcoming shift, you want to find a way for truck drivers to use these predictions to pick where they will park. You need to create an application prototype to show the engineering team how a truck driver would interact with the shift sales forecast model. The application will allow a user to pick a city and shift time (AM or PM) and show predicted sales by location on a map.

### Step 1 - Confirming Prerequisites
- The Streamlit App leverages the Python environment, authentication file, and user-defined function from Step 3. Confirm the following requirements:
  - The Python 3.8 environment py38_env_tb1 has been created.
  - The data_scientist_auth.json file has been filled out.
  - The [tasty_bytes_snowpark_101.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-tasty-bytes-snowpark-101-for-data-science/blob/main/tasty_bytes_snowpark_101.ipynb) notebook has been run.

### Step 2 - Optional: Reviewing the Code
- Open [streamlit_app.py](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-tasty-bytes-snowpark-101-for-data-science/blob/main/streamlit_app.py)
- Identify where the connection to Snowflake happens.
- Identify where the model inference user-defined function is called to give shift sale predictions on the fly.

### Step 3 - Launching the App
- In the terminal, navigate to the cloned GitHub repo and activate the py38_env_tb1 Python environment
  ```  
  conda activate py38_env_tb1
  ```
- Launch the application
  ```  
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```
- Use the drop down menu to select a city and view the updated recommendations.
