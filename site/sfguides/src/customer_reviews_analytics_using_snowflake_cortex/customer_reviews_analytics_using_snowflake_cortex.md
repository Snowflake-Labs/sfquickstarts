## Translate multilingual reviews
Duration: 2

### Enabled by Cortex Translate

You will leverage **Translate** - one of the **Snowflake Cortex specialised LLM functions** are available in Snowpark ML, to translate the multilingual reviews to english to enable easier analysis. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `CORTEX_TRANSLATE`.

  ```python
  # Conditionally translate reviews that are not english using Cortex Translate
  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('TRANSLATED_REVIEW',when(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en"), \
                                                              cortex.Translate(F.col('REVIEW'), \
                                                                              F.col('LANGUAGE'), \
                                                                              "en")) \
                                    .otherwise(F.col('REVIEW')))

  reviews_df.filter(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en")).select(["REVIEW","LANGUAGE","TRANSLATED_REVIEW"]).show(3)
  ```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Categorise unstructured review text data 
Duration: 5

### Overview
In this section, you will make use of **Snowflake Cortex - Complete** to categorise reviews to understand:
  * How good their overall experience was
  * How likely their customers are to recommend Tasty Bytes food trucks to someone they know 

### Get ratings based on review

* You will utilize **Snowflake Cortex - Complete** function to understand at scale based on a given customer's review what rating that customer is likely to rate their experience at the food truck. The prompt consists of the instruction of the task along with a sample example of the completed task also known as **one-shot learning**. This prompt is then provided to complete function along with the review. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `GET_RATINGS`.

  ```python
  # Prompt to get a rating based on a customer review
  # We provide one shot incontext learning to better the answers we get from LLM
  prompt = """[INST]
  ### 
  You are tasked with rating cutsomer reviews for global food truck network called tasty bytes. \
  Rating can be one of the following - awful, poor, okay, good, excellent such that awful is the worst \
  possible rating and excellent is the best possible rating. Include only the rating in the output \
  without any additional text. \
  Rate the following review:
  The "Freezing Point" ice cream truck in Seoul offered a mix of classic and unique \
  options. The Sugar Cone and Waffle Cone were both fresh and crisp, providing a satisfying crunch. The \
  Bottled Water and Ice Tea were standard, as expected. The standout, however, was the Mango Sticky Rice \
  - a delightful blend of sweet and tangy, it was a refreshing twist to the usual ice cream flavors. The \
  service was efficient, but lacked a personal touch. Overall, it\'s a decent choice for a quick, cool \
  treat in the city.
  Rating : good
  Rate the following review: 
  ###"""

  # Ask cortex complete and create a new column
  review_df = reviews_df.withColumn('RATING', cortex.Complete('mixtral-8x7b', \
                                                              F.concat(F.lit(prompt), \
                                                                      F.col('REVIEW'), \
                                                                      F.lit("""[/INST]"""))))\
  .withColumn('CLEAN_RATING', when(F.contains(F.lower(F.col('RATING')), F.lit('awful')), \
                                                              F.lit('awful')) \

                                    .otherwise(F.lit('unsure')))

  review_df.select(["REVIEW","CLEAN_RATING"]).show(3)
  ```
### Get intention to recommed based on review

* You can understand if a customer would recommend the food truck based on their review using **Snowflake Cortex - Complete**. This time prompt doesn't contain any sample examples for the task within the prompt just the task instruction - **zero shot learning**. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `INTENT_TO_RECOMMEND`.

  ```python
  # Prompt to understand whether a customer would recommend food truck based on their review 
  prompt = """[INST]
  ### 
  Tell me based on the following food truck customer review, will they recommend the food truck to \
  their friends and family? Answer should be only one of the following words - \
  "Likely" or "Unlikely" or "Unsure". Make sure there are no additional additional text.
  Review -
  ###"""

  # Ask cortex complete and create a new column
  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('RECOMMEND', cortex.Complete('snowflake-arctic', \
                                                              F.concat(F.lit(prompt), \
                                                                      F.col('REVIEW'), \
                                                                      F.lit("""[/INST]"""))))\
  .withColumn('CLEAN_RECOMMEND', when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Likely')), \
                                                              F.lit('Likely')) \
                                        .when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Unlikely' )), \
                                                              F.lit('Unlikely')) \
              .when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Unsure' )), \
                                                              F.lit('Unsure')) \
                                    .otherwise(F.lit('NA')))

  reviews_df.select(["REVIEW","CLEAN_RECOMMEND"]).show(3)
  ```
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Understand customer sentiment 
Duration: 2

### Enabled by Cortex Sentiment

So far you saw Snowflake Cortex - Translate & Complete. Next, you will look at another **task specific LLM function in Cortex - Sentiment**. This sentiment function is used to understand customer's tone based on the review they provided. Sentiment return value between -1 and 1 such that -1 is the most negative while 1 is the most positive. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `CORTEX_SENTIMENT`.

```python
# Understand the sentiment of customer review using Cortex Sentiment
reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('SENTIMENT', cortex.Sentiment(F.col('REVIEW')))

reviews_df.select(["REVIEW","SENTIMENT"]).show(3)
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Dive deeper with aspect based sentiment
Duration: 2

### Enabled by Cortex Complete 

Taking this analysis a step further, you will be looking at aspect based sentiment instead of just the overall sentiment of review and understand what the customers thinks about different aspects like food quality, service, pricing etc. This done by leveraging **Snowflake cortex - Complete** coupled with a prompt that includes one shot example. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `ASPECT_BASED_SENTIMENT`.

  ```python
  # Prompt to understand sentiment for different categories mentioned in the customer review
  # We employ one shot incontext learning to inform LLM
  prompt = """[INST]
  ### 
  You are analyzing food-truck customer reviews to undertsand what a given review says about different relevant categories like \
  food quality, menu options, staff, overall experience, price, ambience, customer support, \
  hygiene standards etc and if sentiment is negative,positive or neutral for that category. \
  Only answer in a single valid JSON containing "category", "sentiment" and "details". \
  Make sure there is no additional text and not mention categories in answer which are not \
  talked in the review. \
  Get category based sentiment for the follwoing customer review:
  "This food truck offers a disappointing experience. \
  The menu lacks healthy options and the food quality is subpar. Finding a parking spot near the \
  truck can also be a frustrating ordeal. Additionally, the value for money is not worth it. To top \
  it all off, the service provided at this food truck is less than pleasant, adding to the overall \
  negative dining experience. Tried reaching out the customer support but was unable to get through." 
  Answer : [{     "category": "food quality",     "sentiment": "negative",    "details": "subpar quality"   }, {     "category": "menu options",     "sentiment": "negative",     "details": "lacks healthy options"   },   {     "category": "staff",     "sentiment": "negative",     "details": "unpleasant"   },   {     "category": "price",     "sentiment": "negative",     "details": "not worth the money"   },   {     "category": "experience",     "sentiment": "negative",     "details": "regrettable dining experience"   },   {     "category": "customer support",     "sentiment": "negative",     "details": "unable to get through"   } ].
  Get category based sentiment for the follwoing customer review:

## Identify the issues
Duration: 5

### Overview

In this section, you will leverage **Snowflake Cortex - Complete** to identify the issues that are mentioned in customer reviews and understand:
  * What is going wrong at business level?
  * What is going wrong at truck level?

### Issues at business level

* In this step, 100 most negative reviews are aggregrated and provided to **Snowflake Cortex - Complete** along with prompt to identify the  main issues found in those reviews. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `ALL_MOST_NEG_100`.

  ```python
  # Aggregrate the 100 most negative reviews for tasty bytes
  reviews_agg_ = reviews_df.order_by(F.col('SENTIMENT')).select(F.col('REVIEW')).first(100)

  reviews_agg_str = ''.join(map(str,reviews_agg_))

  # Prompt to summarize the three top issues flagged in the aggregated reviews
  prompt = """[INST]###Summarize the issues mentioned in following aggregated food truck customer reviews with three \
  concise bullet points under 50 words each such that each bullet point also has a heading along with \
  recommendations to remedy those issues.###""" + reviews_agg_str + """[/INST]"""

  # Answer from Cortex Complete
  print(cortex.Complete('mistral-large', prompt))
  ```
### Issues at truck level 

* Aggregate sentiment at truck level using `Snowpark Dataframe` functions. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `SENTIMENT_BY_TRUCK`.

  ```python
  # Get average sentiment of reviews for Trucks 
  truck_agg_reviews_df = reviews_df.groupBy(F.col('TRUCK_ID')) \
                  .agg(F.avg(F.col('SENTIMENT')).alias('AVG_SENTIMENT'),F.count(F.col('REVIEW_ID')).alias('REVIEW_COUNT')) 
  truck_agg_reviews_df.show(3)
  ```
* Average sentiment by truck is utilized to find truck which is the most negatively reviewed truck and has atleast 10 reviews. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `MOST_NEGATIVELY_REVIEWED_TRUCK`.

  ```python
  # Get the truck with most negative average sentiment
  truck_agg_reviews_df.filter(F.col('REVIEW_COUNT') >= 10).order_by(F.col('AVG_SENTIMENT')) \
                  .select(F.col('TRUCK_ID')).limit(1).collect()[0][0]
  ```
* Quick analysis of the most negative reviews for Truck 5 to understand the main issues that the customers complain about by leveraging **Snowflake cortex - Complete**. Similar to how it was performed at the business level. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `UNDERSTAND_TRUCK_ISSUES_MD`.

  ```python
  # Aggregate the most negative reviews for Truck 5
  reviews_agg_ = reviews_df.filter(F.col('TRUCK_ID') == cells.MOST_NEGATIVELY_REVIEWED_TRUCK)\
                .order_by(F.col('SENTIMENT')).select(F.col('REVIEW')).first(100)

  reviews_agg_str = ''.join(map(str,reviews_agg_))

  # Prompt to understand the main issues with Truck 5
  prompt = """[INST]###Summarize three main issues mentioned in following aggregated customer review with three concise bullet 
  points under 50 words each such that each bullet point also has a heading.###""" + reviews_agg_str + """[/INST]"""

  # Print Cortex Complete's answer
  print(cortex.Complete('mistral-large', prompt))
  ```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Generate email response
Duration: 2
### Take action assisted by Cortex Complete

In the final step, you will utilize **Snowflake Cortex - Complete** to draft an email to the owner of the most negatively reviewed truck summarizing the issues that are highlighted in cutsomer reviews along with any recommendation to remedy those issues.This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `GENERATE_EMAIL_RESPONSE`.

  ```python
  # Prompt to get an email draft which reports the main issues with Truck 5 with recommendations to solve
  prompt =""" [INST]### Write me survey report email to the franchise owner summarizing the issues mentioned in following \
  aggregated customer review with three concise bullet points under 50 words each such that each bullet \
  point also has a heading along with recommendations to remedy those issues.###"""+ reviews_agg_str +""" \
