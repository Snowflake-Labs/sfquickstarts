# Build and Evaluate RAG with LangChain and Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 5

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge. In this guide, you'll learn how to build a RAG application using the `langchain-snowflake` package with `SnowflakeCortexSearchRetriever` and `ChatSnowflake`. You'll then evaluate your RAG's performance using TruLens and Snowflake's AI Observability features.

By combining Snowflake's data platform capabilities with LangChain's flexible framework, you'll create a powerful RAG system that can answer questions based on your own data.

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up a Snowflake environment for RAG applications
- How to create a retriever using Snowflake Cortex Search
- How to build a complete RAG chain with LangChain and Snowflake
- How to evaluate RAG performance using TruLens
- How to analyze evaluation results in Snowflake

### What You'll Build

A complete RAG application that can answer questions about sales conversations by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating contextually appropriate responses. You'll also implement evaluation metrics to measure the quality of your RAG system.

### What You'll Need

- Access to a [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/)
- A Snowflake account with Cortex features enabled
- Valid Snowflake credentials
- Python 3.8+

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setup

Duration: 10

Firstly, to follow along with this quickstart, you can click on [build-and-evaluate-rag-with-langchain-and-snowflake.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-and-evaluate-rag-with-langchain-and-snowflake/blob/main/build-and-evaluate-rag-with-langchain-and-snowflake.ipynb) to download the Notebook from GitHub.

### Environment Configuration

Before we can build our RAG application, we need to prepare our Snowflake environment with data and search capabilities. This involves:

1. **Loading sample data**: We'll use sales conversation transcripts as our knowledge base
2. **Creating a Cortex Search Service**: This will index our data and enable semantic search

Run the SQL commands in the [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-and-evaluate-rag-with-langchain-and-snowflake/blob/main/setup.sql) file in your Snowflake environment to:

- Create the necessary database, schema, and tables
- Load sample sales conversation data
- Set up the Cortex Search Service with appropriate indexing configuration
- Enable cross-region inference for access to Claude 4

### Installing Required Packages

Notebooks come pre-installed with common Python libraries for data science and machine learning. For this guide, we'll need to install additional packages specific to our RAG implementation:

```python
%pip install --quiet -U langchain-core langchain-snowflake trulens-core trulens-providers-cortex trulens-connectors-snowflake trulens-apps-langchain
```

> aside positive
> IMPORTANT:
> - Make sure your Snowflake account has Cortex features enabled
> - You'll need appropriate permissions to create databases, schemas, and search services

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Creating a Snowflake Session

Duration: 5

### Setting Up Environment Variables

To securely connect to Snowflake, we'll configure our credentials as environment variables. This approach keeps sensitive information out of your code and follows security best practices.

```python
import os

os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"] = "your_account_identifier"
os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_USER"] = "your_username"
os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"] = "your_password"
os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE"] = "SALES_INTELLIGENCE_WH"
os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE"] = "SALES_INTELLIGENCE"
os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA"] = "DATA"
```

### Creating a Snowflake Session

Now we'll create a session that will be used by both the retriever and LLM components:

```python
from langchain_snowflake import create_session_from_env

session = create_session_from_env()
```

This session will handle authentication and connection management for all Snowflake operations in our RAG application.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Building the Retriever

Duration: 10

### Creating a Cortex Search Retriever

The retriever is responsible for finding relevant documents from our knowledge base. We'll use `SnowflakeCortexSearchRetriever` which leverages Snowflake's Cortex Search capabilities:

```python
from langchain_snowflake import SnowflakeCortexSearchRetriever

# Replace with your actual Cortex Search service
CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE = "SALES_INTELLIGENCE.DATA.SALES_CONVERSATION_SEARCH"

retriever = SnowflakeCortexSearchRetriever(
    session=session,
    service_name=CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE,
    k=3,  # Number of documents to retrieve
    auto_format_for_rag=True,  # Automatic document formatting
    content_field="TRANSCRIPT_TEXT",  # Extract content from this metadata field
    join_separator="\n\n",  # Separator used for multiple documents
    fallback_to_page_content=True  # Fall back to page_content if metadata field is empty
)
```

### Testing the Retriever

Let's test our retriever to make sure it's working correctly:

```python
import textwrap

docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What happened in our last sales conversation with DataDriven?")

for doc in docs:
    wrapped_text = textwrap.fill(doc.page_content, width=80)
    print(f"{wrapped_text}\n{'-' * 120}")
```

The retriever should return the most relevant documents from our sales conversations that match the query about DataDriven.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Building the RAG Chain

Duration: 15

### Creating the LLM Component

Now we'll set up the language model component using Snowflake's Cortex LLM capabilities:

```python
from langchain_snowflake import ChatSnowflake

# Initialize chat model
llm = ChatSnowflake(
    session=session, 
    model="claude-4-sonnet", 
    temperature=0.1, 
    max_tokens=1000
)
```

### Creating the RAG Prompt Template

We'll create a prompt template that instructs the model to answer questions based on the retrieved context:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Create RAG prompt template
rag_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
Answer the question based on the following context from Snowflake Cortex Search:

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Provide a comprehensive answer based on the retrieved context. If the context doesn't contain enough information, say so clearly.
""")
```

### Building the Complete RAG Chain

Now we'll chain everything together using LangChain's LCEL (LangChain Expression Language):

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

# Build RAG chain
rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()} | rag_prompt | llm
)
```

### Testing the RAG Chain

Let's test our RAG chain with a sample question:

```python
response = rag_chain.invoke("What happened in our last sales conversation with DataDriven?")
print(f"{response.content}")
```

The RAG chain should retrieve relevant context about DataDriven from our knowledge base and generate a comprehensive answer based on that context.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Evaluating RAG Performance

Duration: 20

### Setting Up TruLens with Snowflake

To evaluate our RAG application, we'll use TruLens with Snowflake integration:

```python
from trulens.apps.langchain import TruChain
from trulens.connectors.snowflake import SnowflakeConnector

tru_snowflake_connector = SnowflakeConnector(snowpark_session=session)

app_name = "sales_assistance_rag"
app_version = "cortex_search"

tru_rag = TruChain(
    rag_chain,
    app_name=app_name,
    app_version=app_version,
    connector=tru_snowflake_connector,
    main_method_name="invoke"
)
```

### Creating an Evaluation Run

We'll create a run configuration and dataset for our evaluation:

```python
import pandas as pd
from trulens.core.run import Run, RunConfig
from datetime import datetime

# Create a dataset of test queries
queries = [
    "What happened in our last sales conversation with DataDriven?",
    "What is the status of the deal with DataDriven?",
    "What is the status of the deal with HealthTech?"
]

queries_df = pd.DataFrame(queries, columns=["query"])

# Create a run configuration
run_name = f"experiment_1_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"

run_config = RunConfig(
    run_name=run_name,
    dataset_name="sales_queries",
    source_type="DATAFRAME",
    dataset_spec={
        "input": "query",
    },
)

# Create and start the run
run: Run = tru_rag.add_run(run_config=run_config)
run.start(input_df=queries_df)
```

### Computing Evaluation Metrics

We'll compute several key metrics to evaluate our RAG system:

```python
import time

# Wait for all invocations to complete
while run.get_status() != "INVOCATION_COMPLETED":
    time.sleep(3)

# Compute metrics
run.compute_metrics([
    "answer_relevance",
    "context_relevance",
    "groundedness",
])
```

These metrics will help us understand:

- How well the answer addresses the user query (answer_relevance)
- How relevant the retrieved context is to the query (context_relevance)
- How well the answer is supported by the retrieved context (groundedness)

### Viewing Evaluation Results

You can view the evaluation results in Snowflake's AI Observability UI: [Open in Snowflake AI Observability](https://app.snowflake.com/_deeplink/#/ai-evaluations/databases/SALES_INTELLIGENCE/schemas/DATA/applications/SALES_ASSISTANCE_RAG?utm_source=quickstart&utm_medium=quickstart&utm_campaign=-us-en-all&utm_content=app-build-and-evaluate-rag-with-langchain-and-snowflake)

1. Navigate to the Snowflake AI Observability page
2. Filter by your app_name, app_version, and run_name
3. Inspect individual invocations and their metrics
4. Identify areas for improvement in your RAG system
