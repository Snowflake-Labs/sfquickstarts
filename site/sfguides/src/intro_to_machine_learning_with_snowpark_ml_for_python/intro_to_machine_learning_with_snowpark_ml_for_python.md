# Getting Started with ML Development in Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Through this quickstart guide, you will get an introduction to [Snowflake for Machine Learning](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/). You will set up your Snowflake and Python environments and build an ML development workflow from feature engineering to model training and batch inference with Snowflake ML all from a set of unified Python APIs.

### What is Snowflake ML?

Snowflake ML is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning in a single platform on top of your governed data. Data scientists and ML engineers can easily and securely develop and productionize scalable features and models without any data movement, silos or governance tradeoffs.

Capabilities for model development and inference include: 
- **Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime** for a familiar notebook interface that runs on scalable compute optimized for efficient data loading and distributed model training and hyperparameter tuning over multiple CPUs or GPUs.
- **Snowflake ML APIs** for distributed feature engineering, distributed training, and distributed hyperparameter optimization
- **Snowflake Feature Store** for continuous, automated refreshes on batch or streaming data
- **ML Jobs** to easily deploy and orchestrate ML pipelines over Snowflake data from any IDE of choice
- **Snowflake Model Registry** to manage models and their metadata, with model serving for inference with CPUs or GPUs
- **ML Lineage** to trace end-to-end feature and model lineage 
- **ML Explainability** to better understand the features the model considers most impactful when generating predictions
- **ML Observability** to monitor performance metrics for models running inference in Snowflake

To get started with Snowflake ML, developers can use the Python APIs from the [Snowflake ML library](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/snowpark-ml), directly from Snowflake Notebooks. 

**Snowflake ML provides the following advantages:**
- Transform your data and train your models using open-source Python ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and xgboost
- Streamline model management and batch inference with built-in versioning support and role-based access control catering to both Python and SQL users
- Keep your ML pipeline running within Snowflake's security and governance perimeters
- Take advantage of the performance and scalability of Snowflake's scalable computing platform.

Learn more about model development with [Snowflake ML APIs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/snowpark-ml) and deployment with the [Snowflake Model Registry](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/snowpark-ml-mlops).

### What you will learn 
This quickstart will focus on building a custom ML workflow using the following features: 
- [Snowflake Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks), which comes pre-integrated with Snowflake ML capabilities.
- [Snowflake ML APIs](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/modeling#distributed-preprocessing) for distributed feature engineering and model training.
- [Snowflake Model Registry](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/snowpark-ml-mlops), which provides scalable and secure model management of ML models - whether you trained them in Snowflake or another ML platform. Using these features, you can build and operationalize a complete ML workflow, taking advantage of Snowflake's scale and security features. It also includes an [explainability function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/model-explainability) based on [Shapley values](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-shapley-value-for-ml-models-f1100bff78d1).

## Using Snowflake Notebooks
Duration: 2

To get started using Snowflake Notebooks, first login to Snowsight and run the following [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowflake-ml-for-python/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) in a SQL worksheet. Sign up for a 30-day [free trial](https://signup.snowflake.com/) account, if required. This will connect to the git repo where all the Snowflake Notebooks are stored and create them for you in your Snowflake environment.

## Set up the data in Snowflake
Duration: 7

**Change role to** `ML_MODEL_HOL_USER`

Navigate to `Notebooks` > `ML_HOL_DATA_INGEST`.

Within this notebook, we will clean and ingest the `diamonds` dataset into a Snowflake table from an external stage. The `diamonds` dataset has been widely used in data science and machine learning, and we will use it to demonstrate Snowflake's native data science transformers throughout this quickstart. 

The overall goal of this ML project is to predict the price of diamonds given different qualitative and quantitative attributes.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## ML Feature Transformations
Duration: 10

**Change role to** `ML_MODEL_HOL_USER`

Navigate to `Notebooks` > `ML_HOL_FEATURE_TRANSFORM`.

In this notebook, we will walk through a few transformations on the `diamonds` dataset that are included in the Snowflake ML APIs. We will also build a preprocessing pipeline to be used in the notebook.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## ML Model Training and Inference
Duration: 15

**Change role to** `ML_MODEL_HOL_USER`

Navigate to `Notebooks` > `ML_HOL_MODELING`.

In this notebook, we will illustrate how to train an XGBoost model with the `diamonds`. We also show how to execute batch inference and model explainability through the Snowflake Model Registry.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Conclusion and Resources
Congratulations, you have successfully completed this quickstart! Through this quickstart, we were able to showcase Snowflake for Machine Learning through the introduction of native model development and operations capabilities. Now, you can run data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and batch inference in a few lines of code.
