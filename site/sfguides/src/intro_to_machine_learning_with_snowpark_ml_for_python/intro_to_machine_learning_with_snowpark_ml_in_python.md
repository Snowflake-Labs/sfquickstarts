# Intro to Machine Learning with Snowpark ML for Python
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Through this quickstart guide, you will explore what's new in Snowpark for Machine Learning. You will set up your Snowflake and Python environments and build an end to end ML workflow from feature engineering to model training and deployment using Snowpark ML.

### What is Snowpark?

Snowpark is the set of libraries and runtimes that securely enable developers to deploy and process Python code in Snowflake.

**Familiar Client Side Libraries** - Snowpark brings deeply integrated, DataFrame-style programming and OSS compatible APIs to the languages data practitioners like to use. It also includes a set of Snowpark ML APIs for more efficient ML modeling (GA soon) and ML operations (public preview soon).

**Flexible Runtime Constructs** - Snowpark provides flexible runtime constructs that allow users to bring in and run custom logic. Developers can seamlessly build data pipelines, ML models, and data applications with User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures.

### What is Snowpark ML?

[Snowpark ML](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/index) includes the Python library and underlying infrastructure for end-to-end ML workflows in Snowflake. Snowpark ML has 2 APIs: Snowpark ML Modeling (GA soon) for model development and Snowpark ML Operations including the Snowpark Model Registry (public preview soon) for model deployment and management. 

This quickstart will focus on
* Snowpark ML Modeling API, which scales out feature engineering and simplifies ML training execution for faster and more intuitive model development.
* Snowpark Model Registry, which provides scalable and secure deployment, management, and inference of ML models in Snowflake compute, including warehouses and Snowpark Container Services. 

Using these features, you can build and operationalize a complete ML workflow, taking advantage of Snowflake’s scale and security features.

**Preprocessing:** Improve performance and scalability with distributed, multi-node execution for common feature engineering functions

**Model Training:** Execute training for popular scikit-learn and xgboost models without manual creation of Stored Procedures or UDFs

**Model management and deployment:** Manage and deploy models and their metadata easily into Snowflake warehouses as UDFs, or Snowpark Container Services as Service endpoints for batch inference

By letting you perform these tasks within Snowflake, snowpark-ml provides the following advantages:
* Transform your data and train your models using popular Python ML frameworks such as scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm without moving data out of Snowflake
* Streamline model management and deployment with built-in versioning support and role-based access control catering to both Python and SQL users
* Keep your ML pipeline running within Snowflake's security and governance perimeters
* Take advantage of the performance and scalability of Snowflake's scalable computing platform.

The first batch of algorithms provided in Snowpark Python is based on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) preprocessing transformations from [sklearn.preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing), as well as estimators that are compatible with those in the scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm libraries.

## Set up the Snowflake environment
Duration: 2

Run the following SQL commands in a SQL worksheet to create the [warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html), [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database.html) and [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html).

```SQL
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE ML_HOL_WH; --by default, this creates an XS Standard Warehouse
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE ML_HOL_DB;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA ML_HOL_SCHEMA;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE ML_HOL_ASSETS; --to store model assets

-- create csv format
CREATE FILE FORMAT IF NOT EXISTS ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.CSVFORMAT 
    SKIP_HEADER = 1 
    TYPE = 'CSV';

-- create external stage with the csv format to stage the diamonds dataset
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.DIAMONDS_ASSETS 
    FILE_FORMAT = ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.CSVFORMAT 
    URL = 's3://sfquickstarts/intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/diamonds.csv';
    -- https://sfquickstarts.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/diamonds.csv

LS @DIAMONDS_ASSETS;
```

These can also be found in the **setup.sql** file.

## Set up the Python environment
Duration: 7

### Snowpark for Python and Snowpark ML

- Download and install the miniconda installer from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). (OR, you may use any other Python environment with Python 3.9, for example, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)).

- Open a new terminal window and execute the following commands in the same terminal window:

  1. Create the conda environment.
  ```
  conda env create -f conda_env.yml
  ```

  2. Activate the conda environment.
  ```
  conda activate snowpark-ml-hol
  ```

  2. `Optionally` start notebook server:
  ```
  $ jupyter notebook &> /tmp/notebook.log &
  ```  

- Update [connection.json](connection.json) with your Snowflake account details and credentials.
  Here's a sample based on the object names we created in the last step:

```
{
  "account"   : "<your_account_identifier_goes_here>",
  "user"      : "<your_username_goes_here>",
  "password"  : "<your_password_goes_here>",
  "role"      : "ACCOUNTADMIN",
  "warehouse" : "ML_HOL_WH",
  "database"  : "ML_HOL_DB",
  "schema"    : "ML_HOL_SCHEMA"
}
```

> aside negative
> 
> **Note:** For the account parameter above, specify your account identifier and do not include the snowflakecomputing.com domain name. Snowflake automatically appends this when creating the connection. For more details on that, refer to the documentation.

Open the following jupyter notebook and run each of the cells: [2_snowpark_ml_feature_transformations.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/blob/main/2_snowpark_ml_feature_transformations.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will walk through a few transformations on the `diamonds` dataset that are included in the Snowpark ML Preprocessing API. We will also build a preprocessing pipeline to be used in the ML modeling notebook.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## ML Model Training and Deployment
Duration: 15

Open the following jupyter notebook and run each of the cells: [3_snowpark_ml_model_training_deployment.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/blob/main/3_snowpark_ml_model_training_deployment.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will illustrate how to train an XGBoost model with the `diamonds` dataset using the Snowpark ML Modeling API. We also show how to do inference and deploy the model to a Snowflake Warehouse through the Snowpark Model Registry.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
