# Intro to Machine Learning with Snowpark ML for Python
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Through this quickstart guide, you will explore what's new in Snowpark for Machine Learning. You will set up your Snowflake and Python environments and build an end to end ML workflow from feature engineering to model training and deployment using Snowpark ML.

### What is Snowpark?

Snowpark is the set of libraries and runtimes that securely enable developers to deploy and process Python code in Snowflake.

**Familiar Client Side Libraries** - Snowpark brings deeply integrated, DataFrame-style programming and OSS compatible APIs to the languages data practitioners like to use. It also includes a set of  Snowpark ML APIs for more efficient ML modeling (public preview) and ML operations (private preview).

**Flexible Runtime Constructs** - Snowpark provides flexible runtime constructs that allow users to bring in and run custom logic. Developers can seamlessly build data pipelines, ML models, and data applications with User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures.

### What is Snowpark ML?

Snowpark ML is a new library for faster and more intuitive end-to-end ML development in Snowflake. Snowpark ML has 2 APIs: Snowpark ML Modeling (public preview) for model development and Snowpark ML operations (private preview) for model deployment. 

This quickstart will focus on the Snowpark ML Modeling API, which scales out feature engineering and simplifies ML training execution. 

**Preprocessing:** Improve performance and scalability with distributed, multi-node execution for common feature engineering functions

**Model Training:** Execute training for popular scikit-learn and xgboost models without manual creation of Stored Procedures or UDFs

By letting you perform these tasks in a Snowflake Python application, snowpark-ml provides the following advantages:
- Transform your data and train your models without moving your data out of Snowflake and without having to define and deploy stored procedures that package scikit-learn, xgboost, or lightgbm code.
- Work with APIs similar to those you’re already familiar with, such as scikit-learn.
- Keep your ML pipeline running within Snowflake’s security and governance frameworks.
- Take advantage of the performance and scalability of Snowflake’s data warehouses.

The first batch of algorithms provided in Snowpark Python is based on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) preprocessing transformations from [sklearn.preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing), as well as estimators that are compatible with those in the scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm libraries.

If you do not have a Snowflake account, you can register for a [free trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com/).
- A Snowflake account login with a role that has the ability to create database, schema, tables, stages, user-defined functions, and stored procedures. If not, you will need to register for a free trial or use a different role.

### What You’ll Build 
- A set of notebooks leveraging Snowpark & Snowpark ML for Python:
    - to load and clean data
    - to perform features transformations on the data using Snowpark ML transformers
    - to train an XGBoost ML model using Snowpark ML estimators
    - to deploy the trained model in Snowflake using a Python User Defined Function (UDF)

## Set up the Snowflake environment
Duration: 2

Run the following SQL commands in a SQL worksheet to create the [warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html), [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database.html) and [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html).

```SQL
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE ML_HOL_WH; --by default, this creates an XS Standard Warehouse
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE ML_HOL_DB;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA ML_HOL_SCHEMA;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE ML_HOL_ASSETS; --to store model assets

-- create csv format
CREATE FILE FORMAT IF NOT EXISTS ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.CSVFORMAT 
    SKIP_HEADER = 1 
    TYPE = 'CSV';

-- create external stage with the csv format to stage the diamonds dataset
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.DIAMONDS_ASSETS 
    FILE_FORMAT = ML_HOL_DB.ML_HOL_SCHEMA.CSVFORMAT 
    URL = 's3://sfquickstarts/intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/diamonds.csv';
    -- https://sfquickstarts.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/diamonds.csv

LS @DIAMONDS_ASSETS;
```

These can also be found in the **setup.sql** file.

## Set up the Python environment
Duration: 7

### Snowpark for Python and Snowpark ML

- Download and install the miniconda installer from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). (OR, you may use any other Python environment with Python 3.9, for example, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)).

- Download the latest version of Snowpark ML from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NFe9oUmhJEtx0XPoDkSJtP4eysNKrlcV). Make sure you download the `.tar.bz2` file. **1.0.2 is the latest version as of this guide's publish date.**

- Open a new terminal window and execute the following commands in the same terminal window:

  1. Create the conda environment.
  ```
  conda env create -f conda_env.yml
  ```

  2. Activate the conda environment.
  ```
  conda activate snowpark-ml-hol
  ```

  2. `Optionally` start notebook server:
  ```
  $ jupyter notebook &> /tmp/notebook.log &
  ```  

- Update [connection.json](connection.json) with your Snowflake account details and credentials.
  Here's a sample based on the object names we created in the last step:

```
{
  "account"   : "<your_account_identifier_goes_here>",
  "user"      : "<your_username_goes_here>",
  "password"  : "<your_password_goes_here>",
  "role"      : "ACCOUNTADMIN",
  "warehouse" : "ML_HOL_WH",
  "database"  : "ML_HOL_DB",
  "schema"    : "ML_HOL_SCHEMA"
}
```

> aside negative
> 
> **Note:** For the account parameter above, specify your account identifier and do not include the snowflakecomputing.com domain name. Snowflake automatically appends this when creating the connection. For more details on that, refer to the documentation.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Set up the data in Snowflake
Duration: 7

Open the following jupyter notebook and run each of the cells: [1_snowpark_ml_data_ingest.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/blob/main/1_snowpark_ml_data_ingest.ipynb)

Within this notebook, we will clean and ingest the `diamonds` dataset into a Snowflake table from an external stage. The `diamonds` dataset has been widely used in data science and machine learning, and we will use it to demonstrate Snowflake's native data science transformers throughout this quickstart. 

The overall goal of this ML project is to predict the price of diamonds given different qualitative and quantitative attributes.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## ML Feature Transformations
Duration: 10

Open the following jupyter notebook and run each of the cells: [2_snowpark_ml_feature_transformations.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/blob/main/2_snowpark_ml_feature_transformations.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will walk through a few transformations on the `diamonds` dataset that are included in the Snowpark ML Preprocessing API. We will also build a preprocessing pipeline to be used in the ML modeling notebook.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## ML Model Training and Deployment
Duration: 15

Open the following jupyter notebook and run each of the cells: [3_snowpark_ml_model_training_deployment.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/blob/main/3_snowpark_ml_model_training_deployment.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will illustrate how to train an XGBoost model with the `diamonds` dataset using the Snowpark ML Model API. We also show how to do inference and deploy the model as a UDF. 

***Note: Once Snowpark ML's native model registry is available, this will be the more streamlined approach to deploy your model.***

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Conclusion
