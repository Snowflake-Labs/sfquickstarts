#Resource Optimization: Usage Monitoring

<!-- -------------->

## Overview
This resource optimization guide represents one module of the four contained in the series. These guides are meant to help customers better monitor and manage their credit consumption. Helping our customers build confidence that their credits are being used efficiently is key to an ongoing successful partnership. In addition to this set of Snowflake Quickstarts for Resource Optimization, Snowflake also offers community support as well as Training and Professional Services offerings. To learn more about the paid offerings, take a look at upcoming [education and training](https://www.snowflake.com/education-and-training/). 

This [blog post](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/understanding-snowflakes-resource-optimization-capabilities/) can provide you with a better understanding of Snowflake's Resource Optimization capabilities.

Contact our team at [marketing@snowflake.com](mailto:marketing@snowflake.com), we appreciate your feedback. 

### Usage Monitoring
Usage Monitoring queries are designed to identify the warehouses, queries, tools, and users that are responsible for consuming the most credits over a specified period of time.  These queries can be used to determine which of those resources are consuming more credits than anticipated and take the necessary steps to reduce their consumption.

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to analyze consumption trends and patterns
- how to identify consumption anomolies
- how to analyze partner tool consumption metrics

### What You’ll Need 
- A [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) Account 
- Access to view [Account Usage Data Share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles)

## Query Tiers
Each query within the Resource Optimization Snowflake Quickstarts will have a tier designation just to the right of its name as "(T*)".  The following tier descriptions should help to better understand those designations.

### Tier 1 Queries
At its core, Tier 1 queries are essential to Resource Optimization at Snowflake and should be used by each customer to help with their consumption monitoring - regardless of size, industry, location, etc.

### Tier 2 Queries
Tier 2 queries, while still playing a vital role in the process, offer an extra level of depth around Resource Optimization and while they may not be essential to all customers and their workloads, it can offer further explanation as to any additional areas in which over-consumption may be identified.

### Tier 3 Queries
Finally, Tier 3 queries are designed to be used by customers that are looking to leave no stone unturned when it comes to optimizing their consumption of Snowflake.  While these queries are still very helpful in this process, they are not as critical as the queries in Tier 1 & 2.


## Credit Consumption by Warehouse (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
Shows the total credit consumption for each warehouse over a specific time period.  
#### How to Interpret Results:
Are there specific warehouses that are consuming more credits than the others?  Should they be?  Are there specific warehouses that are consuming more credits than anticipated for that warehouse?
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
// Credits used (all time = past year)
SELECT WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE_SUM
  FROM ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
;

// Credits used (past N days/weeks/months)
SELECT WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE_SUM
  FROM ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())  // Past 7 days
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
;
```

## Average Hour-by-Hour Consumption Over the Past 7 Days (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
Shows the total credit consumption on an hourly basis to help understand consumption trends (peaks, valleys) over the past 7 days. 
#### How to Interpret Results:
At which points of the day are we seeing spikes in our consumption?  Is that expected?
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL (by hour, warehouse)
```sql
// Credits used by [hour, warehouse] (past 7 days)
SELECT START_TIME
      ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
   AND WAREHOUSE_ID > 0  // Skip pseudo-VWs such as "CLOUD_SERVICES_ONLY"
 ORDER BY 1 DESC,2
;
```
#### Screenshot
![alt-text-here](assets/averagehourbyhourconsumption.png)
####SQL (by hour)
```sql
SELECT DATE_PART('HOUR', START_TIME) AS START_HOUR
      ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,AVG(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE_AVG
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
   AND WAREHOUSE_ID > 0  // Skip pseudo-VWs such as "CLOUD_SERVICES_ONLY"
 GROUP BY 1, 2
 ORDER BY 1, 2
;
```

## Average Query Volume by Hour (Past 7 Days) (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
Shows average number of queries run on an hourly basis to help better understand typical query activity.
#### How to Interpret Results:
How many queries are being run on an hourly basis?  Is this more or less than we anticipated?  What could be causing this?
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('HOUR', START_TIME) AS QUERY_START_HOUR
      ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,COUNT(*) AS NUM_QUERIES
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
 WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())  // Past 7 days
 GROUP BY 1, 2
 ORDER BY 1 DESC, 2
;
```

## Warehouse Utilization Over 7 Day Average (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
This query returns the daily average of credit consumption grouped by week and warehouse.
#### How to Interpret Results:
Use this to identify anomolies in credit consumption for warehouses across weeks from the past year.
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
WITH CTE_DATE_WH AS(
  SELECT TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS START_DATE
        ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
        ,SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS CREDITS_USED_DATE_WH
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
   GROUP BY START_DATE
           ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
)
SELECT START_DATE
      ,WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,CREDITS_USED_DATE_WH
      ,AVG(CREDITS_USED_DATE_WH) OVER (PARTITION BY WAREHOUSE_NAME ORDER BY START_DATE ROWS 7 PRECEDING) AS CREDITS_USED_7_DAY_AVG
      ,100.0*((CREDITS_USED_DATE_WH / CREDITS_USED_7_DAY_AVG) - 1) AS PCT_OVER_TO_7_DAY_AVERAGE
  FROM CTE_DATE_WH
QUALIFY CREDITS_USED_DATE_WH > 100  // Minimum N=100 credits
    AND PCT_OVER_TO_7_DAY_AVERAGE >= 0.5  // Minimum 50% increase over past 7 day average
 ORDER BY PCT_OVER_TO_7_DAY_AVERAGE DESC
;
```

## Forecasting Usage/Billing (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
This query provides three distinct consumption metrics for each day of the contract term. (1) the contracted consumption is the dollar amount consumed if usage was flat for the entire term. (2) the actual consumption pulls from the various usage views and aggregates dollars at a day level. (3) the forecasted consumption creates a straight line regression from the actuals to project go-forward consumption.
#### How to Interpret Results:
This data should be mapped as line graphs with a running total calculation to estimate future forecast against the contract amount.
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
SET CREDIT_PRICE = 4.00; --edit this number to reflect credit price
SET TERM_LENGTH = 12; --integer value in months
SET TERM_START_DATE = '2020-01-01';
SET TERM_AMOUNT = 100000.00; --number(10,2) value in dollars

## Queries by Execution Buckets over the Past 7 Days (T2)
###### Tier 2
#### Description:
Group the queries for a given warehouse by execution time buckets
#### How to Interpret Results:
This is an opportunity to identify query SLA trends and make a decision to downsize a warehouse, upsize a warehouse, or separate out some queries to another warehouse
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
WITH BUCKETS AS (

SELECT 'Less than 1 second' as execution_time_bucket, 0 as execution_time_lower_bound, 1000 as execution_time_upper_bound
UNION ALL
SELECT '1-5 seconds' as execution_time_bucket, 1000 as execution_time_lower_bound, 5000 as execution_time_upper_bound
UNION ALL
SELECT '5-10 seconds' as execution_time_bucket, 5000 as execution_time_lower_bound, 10000 as execution_time_upper_bound
UNION ALL

## Warehouses with High Cloud Services Usage (T2)
###### Tier 2
#### Description:
Shows the warehouses that are not using enough compute to cover the cloud services portion of compute, ordered by the ratio of cloud services to total compute
#### How to Interpret Results:
Focus on Warehouses that are using a high volume and ratio of cloud services compute. Investigate why this is the case to reduce overall cost (might be cloning, listing files in S3, partner tools setting session parameters, etc.).  The goal to reduce cloud services credit consumption is to aim for cloud services credit to be less than 10% of overall credits.
####Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
select 
    WAREHOUSE_NAME
    ,SUM(CREDITS_USED) as CREDITS_USED
    ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES) as CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES
    ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES)/SUM(CREDITS_USED) as PERCENT_CLOUD_SERVICES
from "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY"
where TO_DATE(START_TIME) >= DATEADD(month,-1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
and CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES > 0
group by 1
order by 4 desc
;

## Warehouse Utilization (T2)
###### Tier 2
#### Description:
This query is designed to give a rough idea of how busy Warehouses are compared to the credit consumption per hour. It will show the end user the number of credits consumed, the number of queries executed and the total execution time of those queries in each hour window.
#### How to Interpret Results:
This data can be used to draw correlations between credit consumption and the #/duration of query executions. The more queries or higher query duration for the fewest number of credits may help drive more value per credit.
