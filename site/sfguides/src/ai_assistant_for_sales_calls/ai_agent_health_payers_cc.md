### What You Will Learn

- How to use [Snowflake Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks) and [Snowpark Python](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index) for unstructured data processing
- How to leverage [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) for a hybrid (vector and keyword) search engine on text data
- How to use [Cortex LLM functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions) (Cortex Complete) for access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs)
- How to build a chatbot and analytics application using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) in Snowflake


### Prerequisites
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account to access the [GIT REPO](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ai-agent-hcls-payers-cc-cortex-notebooks-mlclassification/tree/main)
- A Snowflake account login with a role that has the ability to create database, schema, tables, stages, user-defined functions, and stored procedures. If not, you will need to register for [a free trial](https://signup.snowflake.com/?_fsi=OuImfiWC&_fsi=OuImfiWC) or use a different role.

## Data and Snowflake Setup
**Duration: 15 minutes**

> **You can access the full code in [this GIT REPO](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ai-agent-hcls-payers-cc-cortex-notebooks-mlclassification/tree/main).**

To get started using Snowflake Notebooks, first login to Snowsight. In the top-left corner, click "+ Create" to create a new Worksheet, and choose "SQL Worksheet".

<br></br>
Paste and run the following [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ai-assistant-for-sales-calls/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) in the SQL worksheet to create Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema).

```sql

```

**Upload required files** to the correct stages within the `SALES_CALLS_SCHEMA`

Click '+ Files' in the top right of the stage. Upload all files that you downloaded from GitHub into the stage. The contents should match the app directory. **Make sure your the files in your stages match the following**:

- *Data Files:* Upload all relevant datasets to the `RAW_DATA` stage from [data]()
<img src="assets/data_stage.png"/>
- *Notebook Files:* Upload notebook files (including environment.yml) to the `NOTEBOOK` stage from [notebook](). Remember to upload [the notebook-specific environment.yml]() file as well.

- *Streamlit Files:* Upload all Streamlit and chatbot-related files to the `CHATBOT_APP` stage from [streamlit](). Remember to upload [the streamlit-specific environment.yml](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-ai-assistant-using-snowflake-co[â€¦]snowflake-notebooks/blob/main/scripts/streamlit/environment.yml) file as well.
