### About this Mendix Application

The application you just downloaded, uploaded to Mendix' version control server and deployed on a free cloud sandbox environment is a free application available on the [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/). Its purpose is to enable, aid and inspire its users on how to tackle integration with Snowflake from the Mendix domain. This application has some pre-installed operational data to showcase the Mendix Data Loader. The pre-installed data is about movies and reviews corresponding to the movies.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Install the Mendix Data Loader

Duration: 5

- Download the Mendix Data Loader from the [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTDZHHIE0/mendix-mendix-data-loader)
- Once a window displaying "successfully Installed" appears, click `Close`, navigate to `Data Products` -> `Apps` -> `Mendix Data Loader`, a documentation page titled `Mendix Data Loader` should appear
- You have successfully deployed the Mendix Data Loader into your Snowflake environment!

### How Will the Mendix Data Loader Interact With the Mendix application?

The Mendix application has a [published OData service](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/published-odata-services/) that exposes the application data for the entities (class definitions) captioned `Movie` and `Review` which are linked to one another through an association. The OData resource for this application can be found along the following path: `Showcase_DataLoader` -> `Resources` -> `Published OData` -> `POS_Movies`. If you are planning to use your own custom application for this quickstart you will use the exposed OData service that you have set up yourself.

In the OData resource, the `General` tab contains information about the exposed service and the entities that are exposed in the service. Each entity has an endpoint from where the values can be retrieved after authentication. In the `Settings` tab, the metadata endpoint contains information about the exposed data structure of the OData resource. Additional endpoints are exposed for each exposed set configured in the `General` tab.

The Mendix Data Loader retrieves the exposed data structure from the metadata endpoint. After which the application will start to provision the application with transient target tables. Then the application retrieves the data from the service feed for each exposed entity found in the metadata. The Mendix Data Loader is developed for the extraction and loading of Mendix data, any data transformation and integration should be performed outside the scope of the Mendix Data Loader's objects.

All the exposed data will be ingested into Snowflake. To retrieve a subset of the exposed data you can use the filter query option, for more information refer to [OData's Basic Tutorial](https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/).

Should any data reside in the specified database and schema from prior ingestion jobs, this data will be lost. For ingestions of multiple sources, we recommend using the same database with a different schema.

## Mendix Data Loader Configuration

Duration: 5

### Starting the Application

Upon starting the application, a documentation page that includes usage instructions is displayed. To start the application, click the `MENDIX_DATA_LOADER` hyperlink in the header.

### Creating Data sources

The home page, titled `Data Source Overview`, displays all your existing data sources. To create a new one, click the `Create` button to access the `Create New Data Source` page. Here, you will provide the following information:

- `Name`: A unique identifier for your data source.
- `API endpoint`: The URL of your published OData resource, `{{YOUR_SAVED_ENDPOINT}}/odata/{{ODATA_NAME}}/v1/` e.g., `https://sfshowcase101-sandbox.mxapps.io/odata/MoviesBasic/v1/`

When you press `Save` for the first time, a popup will appear requesting permissions to grant the application the following privileges:

1. `CREATE DATABASE`: To create the target database where ingested data will be stored.
2. `EXECUTE TASK`: To enable the scheduling of ingestion jobs.

In the modal window, click `Grant Privileges` to approve the request. Once privileges are granted, press `Save` again to save your data source. You will then be redirected to its details page.

### Configuring Authentication

To set up authentication, navigate to the `Authentication Configuration` tab and click the `Edit` button to open the `Edit Authentication Config` page. To start, there are two options, Basic credential authentication and OAuth. For this quickstart we will guide you through the basic credentials authentication configuration.

Choose the `Basic` option in the presented dropdown field and specify the following fields:

- `Username`: For example, SFDataLoaderUser (or any user with access to your OData resource).
- `Password`: For example, MendixSnowflake123 (or the corresponding password for the user).

### Configure the Staging Area

The final step before data ingestion is to configure the staging area. The staging area consists of a target database and target schema where data will temporarily reside before you transport/process it into a database owned by your organization.

- `Target database name`: For example, MOVIE_DB
- `Target schema name`: For example, MOVIE_APP

### Creating a Task to Schedule Ingestion Jobs

Navigate to the `Data Ingestion` tab and click the `New Task` button to start configuring a task for scheduling ingestion jobs. The following fields are mandatory:


- `When should the ingestion task run?` : Choose one of the following options
  - `Custom CRON expression`, If you choose `Custom CRON expression` then the `Custom CRON expression` field is also mandatory.
  - `Every day at 00:00 AM UTC`
  - `Every Monday on 00:00 AM UTC`
  - `Every first day of the month at 00:00 AM UTC`

The other task configuration fields are optional:

- `Time out`: This is an optional setting that can be used to change after how much time (in ms) a timeout exception should happen.
- `Number of retry attempts` : This setting sets how many retries should be performed if an ingestion job fails.
- `Suspend task after number of failures` : This setting sets the number of times a task is allowed to consecutively fail before suspending the task.

Now press the `Schedule Ingestion Task` button. The first time you configure a task you will be prompted to grant the `USAGE` permission on a warehouse you want to use for all tasks created by the Mendix Data Loader. You can view details of the created task on the `Data Ingestion` tab where you can also view its performed ingestion jobs, suspend/enable the task, and drop the task.
