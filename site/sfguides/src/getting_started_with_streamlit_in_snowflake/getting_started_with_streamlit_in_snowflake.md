# Quickstart Guide: Cybersyn Streamlit in Snowflake - Financial Demo
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

![logo-image](assets/FinancialDataSnowflakeNativeApp.png)

In this guide, we will review how to build a Streamlit App within Snowflake that allows you to easily demo Cybersyn’s Financial Data Package data tables with charts built in Vega-Lite.

### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is a pure Python [open source](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) application framework that enables developers to quickly and easily write, share, and deploy data applications. Learn more about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

### What is Vega-Lite? 
Vega-Lite is an [open-source](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.

### What You’ll Build?
An application on Streamlit within Snowflake that connects directly to a data listing acquired (for free) through the Snowflake Marketplace. This application allows users to quickly demonstrate usage examples from data in the [Cybersyn Financial Data Package](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KF7/cybersyn-inc-financial-data-package?search=financial%20data%20package). This data specifically focuses on the US banking system and respective financials and performance.

### What You’ll Learn? 
- How to access data from Snowflake Marketplace
- How to create and run Streamlit in Snowflake
- How to create VegaLite charts in Streamlit

### Prerequisites
A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/)
- To ensure you can mount data from the Marketplace, login to your Snowflake account with the admin credentials that were created with the account in one browser tab (a role with ORGADMIN privileges is required for this step). Keep this tab open during the session.
  - Click on the Billing on the left side panel
  - Click on Terms and Billing
  - Read and accept terms to continue

## Setting up the Streamlit Application
Duration: 4

### Step 1: Accessing Data in Snowflake Marketplace
<button>[Cybersyn Financial Data Package](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KF7)</button>

After logging into your Snowflake account, access [Cybersyn’s Financial Data Package](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KF7/cybersyn-inc-financial-data-package?search=financial%20data%20package) in the Marketplace. 
- Click the Get button on the top right box on the listing
- Read and accept terms by clicking Get again 
  - Note: This data listing is available for free, at no additional charge. 
- The data is now available in your Snowflake instance, as the `FINANCIAL_DATA_PACKAGE` database under Data on the left hand side panel.

### Step 2: Create a Database & Schema
- On the left side panel, click Data. 
- Click the blue + Database button in the top right corner. 
- Create a new database with a name of your choosing (eg. `FINANCIAL_STREAMLIT`) for the Streamlit to live in.
- Create a new Schema in the new database (eg. `FINANCIAL_STREAMLIT`) with a name of your choosing (eg. `STREAMLIT`).

### Step 3: Create a Streamlit
- On the left side panel, click Streamlit. 
- Click the blue button, blue + Streamlit App button in the top right corner.
  - Name your App (eg. Financial Streamlit)
  - Select a Warehouse. 
  - Select the database and schema for your app. If you followed Step 2, select this database (eg. `FINANCIAL_STREAMLIT` and `STREAMLIT`).
  - Click the blue Create button
  - Delete all of the existing code.

### Step 4: Copy the Python code from GitHub
<button>[streamlit_app.py](https://github.com/cybersyn-data/streamlit-in-snowflake-example/blob/main/streamlit_app.py)</button>

- Click the button above which will direct you to our Financial Streamlit Python Setup file that is hosted on GitHub. 
- Within GitHub navigate to the right side and click the ‘Copy raw contents’ button on the top right of the code block. This will copy all of the required Python into your clipboard. 
- Paste the Python code to the Streamlit code block in your newly created Streamlit in Snowflake.

### Step 5: Create a Database & Schema
- Click the blue Run button  on the top right corner. 
- Wait for app to load. 
  - Note: If there is an error then try to refresh the page. If you continue to receive an error, please ensure that under Data you see the `FINANCIAL_DATA_PACKAGE` listing in your databases. 

#### You’ve successfully built the Cybersyn Financial Streamlit in Snowflake!
