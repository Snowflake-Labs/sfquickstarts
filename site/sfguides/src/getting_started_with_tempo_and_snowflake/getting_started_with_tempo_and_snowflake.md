## Finding and Installing Tempo
Duration: 4

### Accessing the Snowflake Marketplace

In the Snowflake Marketplace, you can find the Tempo app or directly access it [here](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZOYXHP3/deeptempo-cybersecurity-tempo).

### Prerequisites for Deployment

Before installing Tempo, ensure you have:
- Grant Tempo necessary permissions including creating warehouses and compute pools
- Configure proper database access
- Verify sufficient storage and compute resources

### Selecting Storage for Your Data

If you want to run Tempo on your own data, follow these steps to select the correct storage before launching the app:

1. Click the **Add** button next to the **on Incident Inference Logs** section
2. In the popup window, click **+Select Data**
3. From the dropdown menu, find and select the appropriate table containing your network flow data
4. Click **Save** to confirm your selection

**Note:** If you would like to use demo data for testing purposes, you can skip this step and proceed with the default configuration.

Once Tempo is successfully installed and running, a management interface launches which will help you monitor and interact with the system.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## User Interface Navigation
Duration: 2

### Main Navigation Menu

The Tempo interface includes several main sections accessible from the navigation menu on the left side:

- **Home**: Dashboard with overview and welcome information
- **Data Sources**: Configure and manage data input sources
- **Threat Overview**: High-level analysis of your network security posture
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed investigation capabilities using Forensichat
- **Deep Investigation**: Advanced analysis of specific threats and sequences
- **Settings**: System configuration and user preferences

### Accessing the Interface

To access and use Tempo:

1. Navigate to the Tempo app in your Snowflake instance, typically found under Data Products > Apps > Tempo
2. The Tempo interface will load, displaying the available features and navigation options
3. Use the left navigation menu to move between different analysis sections

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Executing Procedures Through the UI
Duration: 5

The Tempo interface enables users to run predefined procedures directly from the UI instead of using Snowflake worksheets.

### Important Configuration Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Information:**
- **Inference Procedures** (Incident Classification, MITRE Classification) will default to demo data tables unless you explicitly configure which table to target under Reference Pages
- **Performance Evaluation** and **Model Fine-Tuning** require you to explicitly set the target evaluation or tuning table on the reference page‚Äîthey have no demo defaults
- Ensure you have selected or created the correct source tables before executing procedures, or the command will fail

### Step-by-Step Procedure Execution

1. **Select Your Procedure**
   - Click the **Select Procedure** dropdown menu
   - Choose the desired command from options like "Investigate Sequence üîé", "Incident Classification üõ°Ô∏è", etc.

2. **Enter Required Parameters (if applicable)**
   - For **Investigate Sequence üîé**: Enter the 29-character NetFlow Sequence ID in the text field and press Enter
   - For **Incident Classification üõ°Ô∏è**: Use the **Include MITRE Classification** toggle to enable or disable ATT&CK framework mapping

3. **Execute the Command**
   - Click **Execute Command** to launch the selected procedure
   - The button will be disabled until all required inputs are valid or until the run is completed

4. **Monitor Execution Status**
   - Watch the status indicator above the Execute button:
     - ‚è≥ **Running** (auto-polls every 5 seconds)
     - ‚úÖ **Completed**
     - ‚ùå **Failed**

5. **View Results**
   - Once completed, scroll down to see the output table for your selected procedure:
     - **Investigate Sequence**: Shows raw NetFlow rows and related events
     - **Incident/MITRE Classification**: Displays inference logs with threat classifications
     - **Performance Evaluation**: Lists recent performance metrics and accuracy scores
     - **Model Fine-Tuning**: Returns a summary message with tuning results

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Threat Overview Analysis
Duration: 4

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Distribution

The Threat Overview section provides a comprehensive view of your network security status through MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping. Tempo automatically categorizes detected threats into the following phases:

- **Initial Access**: Events indicating initial compromise attempts
- **Collection**: Data gathering activities by potential attackers
- **Impact**: Actions aimed at manipulation, interruption, or destruction of systems
- **Credential Access**: Attempts to steal user credentials or authentication tokens
- **Privilege Escalation**: Efforts to gain higher-level permissions within systems
- **Discovery**: Network and system reconnaissance activities
- **Exfiltration**: Data theft and unauthorized data transfer attempts
- **Lateral Movement**: Movement between systems within the network
- **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering activities about targets

### Network Security Metrics

The overview dashboard displays key metrics including:
- Unique IP Connections detected
- Total Network Events processed
- Potential Anomalies identified
- Distribution of MITRE ATT&CK tactics observed

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Forensic Analysis with Forensichat
