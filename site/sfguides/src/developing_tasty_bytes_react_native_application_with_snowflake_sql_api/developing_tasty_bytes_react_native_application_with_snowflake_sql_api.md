<img src="assets/tasty_bytes_header.png"/>

In today's data-driven landscape, the majority of applications have evolved to become highly data intensive. However, developing successful data applications can be challenging, particularly as user numbers grow and the volume and complexity of data increase. Snowflake is the driving force behind numerous data applications, empowering software teams to enhance their engineering velocity and create scalable applications without the burden of operational complexities. With its focus on increasing engineering speed, Snowflake offers exceptional performance and scalability for applications. 

To expedite the development of Data Apps, Snowflake offers the SQL API, a RESTful API that enables seamless access and manipulation of data within the Snowflake Database. The SQL API serves as a bridge between your application and Snowflake, allowing you to retrieve and update data programmatically.

In this tutorial, the application you are building helps fictitious food truck company, Tasty Bytes and it's Truck drivers to view the Orders placed by the customers and truck driver can complete the orders upon delivery. This tutorial will guide you through the process of utilizing the SQL API to develop a React Native application for Truck Drivers.

## Setting up the Data in Snowflake
Duration: 3

We are using Tasty Bytes Orders data for this demo. Using the Orders data, you will be building an application for Truck drivers with following capabilities.
- Truck Driver can see the Orders in their Queue
- Driver can complete the order once Ready by updating Order Status in Snowflake
- Driver can see the completed orders.

You will use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#), the Snowflake web interface, to:
- Create Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema)
- Ingest data from S3
- Create Views by joining Data

### Creating Objects, Loading Data, and Joining Data

Navigate to Worksheets, click "+" in the top-right corner to create a new Worksheet, and choose "SQL Worksheet".

Paste and run the following SQL in the worksheet to create Snowflake objects (warehouse, database, schema),
ingest raw orders data from S3, and model it for downstream usage.

```sql
-- use our accountadmin role
USE ROLE accountadmin;

-- create our database
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app;

-- create raw, harmonized, and analytics schemas
-- raw zone for data ingestion
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw;

-- harmonized zone for data processing
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized;

-- analytics zone for data driven insights
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics;

-- create csv file format
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.csv_ff 
type = 'csv';

-- create an external stage pointing to S3
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.s3load
COMMENT = 'Quickstarts S3 Stage Connection'
url = 's3://sfquickstarts/frostbyte_tastybytes/app/app_orders/'
file_format = frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.csv_ff;

-- create our raw.app_order_header table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_header
(
  order_id NUMBER(19,0),
    month NUMBER(2,0),
    day NUMBER(2,0),
    hour NUMBER(2,0),
    minute NUMBER(2,0),
    second NUMBER(2,0),
    order_total NUMBER(19,3),
    order_tax_amount NUMBER(2,0),
    first_name VARCHAR,
    last_name VARCHAR,
    gender VARCHAR,
    order_status VARCHAR
);

-- create our raw.order_detail table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_detail
(
  order_id NUMBER(19,0),
  order_detail_id NUMBER(19,0),
  menu_item_name VARCHAR,
  quantity NUMBER(2,0),
  unit_price NUMBER(19,3)
);

-- create our virtual warehouse
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE tasty_app_wh AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;

-- use our TASTY_APP_WH virtual warehouse so we can load our data
USE WAREHOUSE tasty_app_wh;

-- ingest from S3 into the app_order_header table
COPY INTO frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_header
FROM @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.s3load/app_order_header.csv.gz;

-- ingest from S3 into the app_order_detail table
COPY INTO frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_detail
FROM @frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.s3load/app_order_detail.csv.gz;

-- create our harmonized.data_app_orders_v view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized.data_app_orders_v
  AS
SELECT 
    oh.order_id,
    TIMESTAMP_NTZ_FROM_PARTS(YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()),oh.month,oh.day,oh.hour,oh.second, 0) AS order_ts,
    oh.order_total,
    oh.order_tax_amount,
    oh.first_name,
    oh.last_name,
    oh.gender,
    oh.order_status,
    od.order_detail_id,
    od.menu_item_name,
    od.quantity,
    od.unit_price
FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_header oh
JOIN frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_detail od
ON oh.order_id = od.order_id;

-- promote our view to analytics
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics.data_app_orders_v
  AS
SELECT * FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized.data_app_orders_v;

-- view orders data
SELECT * FROM frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics.data_app_orders_v;
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create User for the Application
Duration: 5

To ensure robust security measures, it is essential to establish a dedicated user account for the application, separate from your personal account. This new account will be utilized for querying Snowflake. Following best security practices, the account will employ key-pair authentication and be granted restricted access within the Snowflake environment.

### Step 1: Generate Public and Private key for Authentication
Run the following commands to create a private and public key. These keys are necessary to authenticate the user with Snowflake.

```Shell
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ openssl genrsa -out snowflake_app_key 4096
$ openssl rsa -in snowflake_app_key -pubout -out snowflake_app_key.pub
```

### Step 2: Create the User and Role in Snowflake and Grant data access to this new Role

Execute the following SQL statements to create the user account and grant access to the data needed for the application.

```SQL
-- use our securityadmin role
USE ROLE securityadmin;

-- create the tasty_bytes_data_app_demo role
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;

-- use our securityadmin role
USE ROLE accountadmin;

-- grant privileges to our tasty_bytes_data_app_demo role
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE tasty_app_wh TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.analytics TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.harmonized TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;
GRANT UPDATE ON TABLE frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app.raw.app_order_header TO ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo;

-- use our useradmin role
USE ROLE useradmin;

-- Open the ~/.ssh/snowflake_app_key.pub file from Step 1 and copy the contents starting just after the PUBLIC KEY header, 
-- and stopping just before the PUBLIC KEY footer for INSERT_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE.
CREATE OR REPLACE USER data_app_demo
RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='<INSERT_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE>' 
DEFAULT_ROLE=frostbyte_tasty_bytes_app 
DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE=tasty_app_wh 
MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD=false;

-- use our securityadmin role
USE ROLE securityadmin;
GRANT ROLE tasty_bytes_data_app_demo TO USER data_app_demo;
```

## Data Application with SQL API
Duration: 10

The application you will be running is written in React Native. 

### Step 1: Get the Source Code
1. Clone the repo using ``` git clone https://github.com/sf-gh-sjasti/TastyBytesReactNativeAppWithSnowflake-SQL_API.git reactNativeApp ```
2. Navigate to the folder, ``` cd reactNativeApp ```
3. Run ``` npm install ``` to install dependancies

### Step 2: Configure the application
1. Open the ``` reactNativeApp ``` folder in VS Code or IDE of your choice.
2. Open the ``` .env ``` file and update ``` PRIVATE_KEY ``` value with the private key. Copy and paste the whole private key from ``` ~/.ssh/snowflake_app_key.pub ``` including header(``` -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ```) and footer(``` -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ```).
3. If you are located in us-west region, Update ``` SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER ``` with your Snowflake Account
   (or) If you are located outside the us-west region, Update ``` SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER ``` as '<SNOWFLAKE ACCOUNT>.<REGION>'.
   To get the snowflake_account value from Snowflake, run ``` SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT() ``` in Snowsight. 
   To get the region value from Snowflake, run ``` SELECT CURRENT_REGION() ``` in Snowsight. 
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER and SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT would be same for us-west. 
4. Update ``` SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT ``` with your Snowflake Account.
5. Update ``` PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT ``` with your user Public Key FingerPrint. To get Public Key Fingerprint, Run the following SQL in Snowsight  ```DESCRIBE USER data_app_demo ``` and get RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_FP property value.

### Step 3: Review the Source Code
We are using Key Pair Authentication to authenticate with Snowflake using SQL API. You can refer to the ``` Tokens.js ``` to understand how we are generating the JWT token. ``` Orders.js ``` has the source code to render Orders screen. You can also refer to this file to find out how to initiate a SQL API call and the headers needed. ``` OrderDetails.js ``` has the source code to render Order Details Screen.

### Step 4: Test the application
1. Run ``` npx expo start --clear ``` and hit ``` w ``` key to run the app in a web browser
2. This launches the app in Web Browser
3. Upon Launch, You can see the InQueue Orders Screen,

<img src="assets/OrdersInQueue.png"/>

4. Now Click on View Order button to see the Order Details.

<img src="assets/OrderDetails.png"/>

5. Click on ORDER READY button to complete the order. This action updates the Order Status value to Completed for this Order and take you back to the InQueue Orders Screen
6. Now, Click on Order History tab to see the completed orders.
