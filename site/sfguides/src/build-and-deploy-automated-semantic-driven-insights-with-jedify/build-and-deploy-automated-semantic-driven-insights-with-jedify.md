<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Installing the Jedify Native App
Duration: 3

In this step, you'll install the Jedify Native App from the Snowflake Marketplace and configure initial settings.

1. Go to the Snowflake App Marketplace and search for "Jedify"
2. Click 'Get' to start the installation process
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant necessary permissions
4. Generate a Jedify Access Key:
   * Visit [power.jedify.com](https://power.jedify.com) to create an account and obtain your API key
   * Once you create an account or log in (if you already have an account), create a new access key by entering a name and clicking "Create Key"
   * When your key is generated, copy the secret key value as it will only be shown once. Store this key securely as you'll need it to authenticate the Jedify Native App

> 
> Note that the API key setup may take a few seconds to complete.

5. In the Snowflake native app UI, click Onboarding to kick off the onboarding process

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Granting permissions
Duration: 5

For Jedify to access your data and provide meaningful insights, you need to grant the necessary permissions.

1. As part of the onboarding flow, you'll be prompted to grant privileges to the Jedify application
2. If your organization uses a proxy server or firewall to control inbound traffic, you'll need to whitelist specific IP addresses

```sql
CREATE NETWORK RULE JEDIFY_ACCESS_RULE
MODE = INGRESS
TYPE = IPV4
VALUE_LIST = (
  '54.82.120.241/32',
  '54.221.135.9/32',
  '54.86.110.214/32',
  '54.226.185.100/32',
  '54.197.160.10/32',
  '174.129.63.235/32',
  '54.227.16.250/32',
  '18.234.244.111/32',
  '3.81.125.12/32',
  '54.144.62.191/32',
  '54.92.151.103/32',
  '18.208.133.145/32',
  '52.6.210.170/32'
);
```

3. Configure the application settings according to your specific requirements
4. Verify that all permissions are correctly applied before proceeding to the next step

> aside negative
> 
> Without proper permissions, Jedify won't be able to access your data sources, which will limit its functionality.


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Connecting Data Sources
Duration: 5

In this step, you'll connect Jedify to your data sources to enable semantic analysis and insights generation.

Jedify's powerful semantic analysis works best when it has access to various data sources within your Snowflake environment. The platform can analyze:

* Structured data (tables and views)
* Unstructured data
* Contextual data
* Non-contextual data

To connect your data sources:

1. Select the databases, schemas, and tables you want to analyze
2. Jedify will automatically scan and index the connected data sources
3. You can review the data sources that have been connected and add additional ones as needed

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Integrating with BI Tools
Duration: 10

Jedify integrates with your existing BI tools to enable model verification and learning from your analytics workflows.

Set up your BI connection by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the BI Connections section in the Jedify app
2. Select your BI system (Looker, Tableau, or Power BI)
3. Provide the necessary credentials: 

   * **Tableau:**
        - Server URL
        - User Email
        - Site name
        - Client ID
        - Secret ID
        - Secret value

   * **Looker:**
        - Base URL
        - Client ID
        - Client Secret

   * **Power BI:**
        - Currently in Alpha, please email [support@jedify.com](mailto:support@jedify.com) to get access
4. Test the connection to ensure it works properly
5. Save your configuration

Once connected, Jedify will:

* Observe queries and usage patterns to improve its semantic understanding
* Verify model predictions against actual BI usage
* Continuously refine its semantic models based on how your organization uses data
* Adapt its processing to your organization's unique analytical needs

This integration allows Jedify to learn from your team's analytical workflows, and improves the relevance and accuracy of its semantic processing.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Running the semantic evaluation
Duration: 5

The Semantic Evaluation reviews your entire setup and assesses whether the configuration completed so far will enable meaningful insights.


1. Jedify will comprehensively analyze:
   * Tables and views you've granted access to
   * BI tool connections (if established)
   * Data coverage across different domains
   * Potential gaps in your data ecosystem
2. Review the evaluation results:
   * Consider granting access to additional data sources
   * Review incomplete permissions
   * Consider connecting a BI Tool

> aside positive
> 
> The evaluation allows you to return to any step, ensuring you can address configuration issues before proceeding.

Jedify's Semantic Evaluation serves as a comprehensive health check that:

* Confirms proper access permissions are in place
* Verifies that connected data sources provide sufficient context
* Assesses the coverage and accuracy of the semantic model that will be built
* Identifies any missing connections or configuration steps

This evaluation ensures that your Jedify setup is optimized before proceeding to the Autonomous Semantic Fusion‚Ñ¢ process, saving time and improving results.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploying as Autonomous Semantic Fusion‚Ñ¢ Model
Duration: 2

After completing all previous steps, the deployment process will start by clicking the "Build" button:

1. This process occurs in the background and typically takes a couple of hours to complete
2. When the model is ready, you'll receive an email notification
3. Log in to [app.jedify.com](https://app.jedify.com) to view and interact with your model

The Autonomous Semantic Fusion‚Ñ¢ model that Jedify builds for you enables:

* Interactive exploration through the Jedify web interface
* Custom Scenarios with Agentic AI for specific needs like reports and data processing
