#Resource Optimization: Billing Metrics

<!-- -------------->

## Overview
This resource optimization guide represents one module of the four contained in the series. These guides are meant to help customers better monitor and manage their credit consumption. Helping our customers build confidence that their credits are being used efficiently is key to an ongoing successful partnership. In addition to this set of Snowflake Quickstarts for Resource Optimization, Snowflake also offers community support as well as Training and Professional Services offerings. To learn more about the paid offerings, take a look at upcoming [education and training](https://www.snowflake.com/education-and-training/). 

This [blog post](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/understanding-snowflakes-resource-optimization-capabilities/) can provide you with a better understanding of Snowflake's Resource Optimization capabilities.

### Billing Metrics
Billing queries are responsible for identifying total costs associated with the high level functions of the Snowflake Cloud Data Platform, which includes warehouse compute, snowpipe compute, and storage costs.  If costs are noticeably higher in one category versus the others, you may want to evaluate what might be causing that.

These metrics also seek to identify those queries that are consuming the most amount of credits.  From there, each of these queries can be analyze for their importance (do they need to be run as frequently, if at all) and explore if additional controls need to be in place to prevent excessive consumption (i.e. resource monitors, statement timeouts, etc.).

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to identify and analyze Snowflake consumption across all services
- how to analyze most resource-intensive queries
- how to analyze serverless consumption
  
### What You’ll Need 
- A [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) Account 
- Access to view [Account Usage Data Share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles)

## Query Tiers
Each query within the Resource Optimization Snowflake Quickstarts will have a tier designation just to the right of its name as "(T*)".  The following tier descriptions should help to better understand those designations.

### Tier 1 Queries
At its core, Tier 1 queries are essential to Resource Optimization at Snowflake and should be used by each customer to help with their consumption monitoring - regardless of size, industry, location, etc.

### Tier 2 Queries
Tier 2 queries, while still playing a vital role in the process, offer an extra level of depth around Resource Optimization and while they may not be essential to all customers and their workloads, it can offer further explanation as to any additional areas in which over-consumption may be identified.

### Tier 3 Queries
Finally, Tier 3 queries are designed to be used by customers that are looking to leave no stone unturned when it comes to optimizing their consumption of Snowflake.  While these queries are still very helpful in this process, they are not as critical as the queries in Tier 1 & 2.

## Billing Metrics (T1)
###### Tier 1
#### Description:
Identify key metrics as it pertains to total compute costs from warehouses,
serverless features, and total storage costs.  
#### How to Interpret Results:
Where are we seeing most of our costs coming from (compute, serverless, storage)?  Are seeing excessive costs in any of those categories that are above expectations?
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
/* These queries can be used to measure where costs have been incurred by 
   the different cost vectors within a Snowflake account including:
   1) Warehouse Costs
   2) Serverless Costs
   3) Storage Costs
   
   To accurately report the dollar amounts, make changes to the variables
   defined on lines 17 to 20 to properly reflect your credit price, the initial
   capacity purchased, when your contract started and the term (default 12 months)

   If unsure, ask your Sales Engineer or Account Executive

## Most Expensive Queries (T2)
###### Tier 2
#### Description:
This query orders the most expensive queries from the last 30 days. It takes into account the warehouse size, assuming that a 1 minute query on larger warehouse is more expensive than a 1 minute query on a smaller warehouse
#### How to Interpret Results:
This is an opportunity to evaluate expensive queries and take some action. The admin could:

-look at the query profile

-contact the user who executed the query

-take action to optimize these queries

#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage

#### SQL
```sql

## Average Cost per Query by Warehouse (T2)
###### Tier 2
#### Description:
This summarize the query activity and credit consumption per warehouse over the last month. The query also includes the ratio of queries executed to credits consumed on the warehouse
#### How to Interpret Results:
Highlights any scenarios where warehouse consumption is significantly out of line with the number of queries executed. Maybe auto-suspend needs to be adjusted or warehouses need to be consolidated.
#### Primary Schema:
Account_Usage
#### SQL
```sql
set credit_price = 4;  --edit this value to reflect your credit price

    ,WC.CREDIT_COST_LAST_MONTH
    ,CAST((WC.CREDIT_COST_LAST_MONTH / QC.QUERY_COUNT_LAST_MONTH) AS decimal(10,2) ) AS COST_PER_QUERY

    SELECT
       WAREHOUSE_NAME
