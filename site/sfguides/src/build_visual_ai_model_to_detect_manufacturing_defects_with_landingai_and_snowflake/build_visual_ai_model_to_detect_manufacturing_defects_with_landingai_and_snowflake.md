# Use Visual AI Models to Detect Defects with LandingLens on Snowflake

## Overview
Duration: 1

In this quickstart, we'll use LandingLens — a Native App available in the Snowflake Marketplace — to create a computer vision model that detects defects in components from a manufacturing environment. After completing this quickstart, users can use the concepts and procedures from this quickstart to build Object Detection, Segmentation, and Classifications models in LandingLens. 

### What Is LandingLens?
LandingLens is a cloud-based Visual AI platform. LandingLens empowers users to create and train Visual AI models even if you don't have a background in AI, machine learning, or computer vision. LandingLens guides you through the process of uploading images, labeling them, training models, comparing model performance, and deploying models.

To users who are familiar with machine learning, LandingLens offers advanced tools to customize the model training process. LandingLens supports advanced deployment options including cloud deployment as well as [Docker](https://support.landing.ai/landinglens/docs/docker-deploy) and [LandingEdge](https://support.landing.ai/landinglens/docs/landingedge-overview), LandingAI’s edge-deployment solution.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Get Sample Images
Duration: 15

Now that you've installed the LandingLens app, you are ready to get the sample images. LandingAI provides a set of sample images as an "app" that can be downloaded from the Snowflake Marketplace. You will use these images to train a computer vision model in LandingLens that detects manufacturing defects.

To get the sample images, follow these instructions:

1. Open the [Sample Dataset for LandingLens: Manufacturing Metal Casting](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZ12K65C6/landingai-sample-dataset-for-landinglens-manufacturing-metal-casting) listing in the Snowflake Marketplace and click **Get**.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_1.png" alt="Sample dataset listing in the Snowflake Marketplace" width="800">

2. Go to **Snowsight** > **Data Products** > **Apps**. Click the **Sample Dataset for LandingLens: Manufacturing Metal Casting** app listing.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_2.png" alt="Open the app" width="800">

3. Click the **Shield** icon in the top right corner of this app page.

4. Click **Review** and allow the CREATE DATABASE privilege, which grants the app to create a database to load the sample data.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_3.png" alt="Grant privileges" width="800">

5. Open the **LLENS_DATA_APP** tab.

6. Click **Create Sample Dataset** to load the dataset into your Snowflake account.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_4.png" alt="Create the database" width="800">

7. Make a note of the location of the images; you will use these later.
      - **Database**: llens_sample_ds_manufacturing
      - **Schema**: ball_bearing
      - **Stage**: dataset

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Build a Defect Detection Project
Duration: 20

Now that you've loaded the sample dataset into your Snowflake account, you're ready to create a computer vision model using those images in LandingLens.

### Load the Images into LandingLens
1. Open LandingLens in Snowflake (use the URL generated when you installed the app).
2. Click **Start First Project** and name your project.
3. Click **Classification**.
4. Click **Sync Snowflake Data**.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_load_1.png" alt="Sync images from Snowflake" width="800">
5. Enter the location that you saved the sample dataset to earlier. The location should be:
      - **Database**: llens_sample_ds_manufacturing
      - **Schema**: ball_bearing
      - **Stage**: dataset
6. You will get a message saying that you don't have access to that location. To fix this, copy the SQL commands at the bottom of the pop-up and run them in a Snowsight worksheet in a different browser tab.
7. Turn on **Classify images based on folder names**.
8. Click the directory path (**⌄ /**) in the **Folder** field. 
9. Select the **data** directory.
10. Click **Sync**.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_load_2.png" alt="Sync images from Snowflake" width="600">
11. All the images in the stage are loaded into the LandingLens project. (Refresh the page to see the images.) The project now has 100 images; 50 images have the class "defects", and 50 have the class "no defects".
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_load_3.png" alt="Images are uploaded and labeled" width="600">

### Train a Classification Model
Now that all of the images are in the LandingLens project and have classes assigned to them, train a computer vision model. When you train a model, you give the labeled images to a deep learning algorithm. This allows the algorithm to "learn" what to look for in images.

To train a model, click **Train**.

<img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_train_1.png" alt="Train the model" width="800">

The right side panel opens and shows the model training progress. This process can take a few minutes.

<img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_train_2.png" alt="Model training progress" width="800">

Once training finishes, you will see the model's predictions and performance information. You can click the model tile in the side panel to see more detailed information. In most real-world use cases, you might need to upload and label more images to improve performance. In this example, the model should be performing well, so we will go to the next step, which is deploying the model.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploy the Model to an Endpoint
Duration: 20

After you are happy with the results of your trained model, you are ready to use it. To use a model, you **deploy** it, which means you put the model in a virtual location so that you can then upload images to it. When you upload images, the model runs **inference**, which means that it detects what it was trained to look for.

In this example, we're going to show how to use Cloud Deployment. You can also deploy models using [LandingEdge](https://support.landing.ai/docs/landingedge-overview) and [Docker](https://support.landing.ai/docs/docker-deploy).

To deploy the model with Cloud Deployment, follow these instructions:

1. Open the **Models** tab.
2. Click **Deploy** in the model's row.

   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_deploy_1.png" alt="Deploy the model" width="800">
3. Name the endpoint and click **Deploy**.

   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_deploy_2.png" alt="Name the endpoint" width="400">
   
4. LandingLens deploys the model to the endpoint and opens the **Deploy** page. You can now use this endpoint to run inference.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_deploy_3.png" alt="View the deployment" width="800">
5. Make a note of the `endpoint_id` that displays in the **Python SDK** script. You will include this when you run inference later.
   <img src="assets/LL_manufacturing_deploy_4.png" alt="Get the endpoint ID" width="600">

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Run Inference

Duration: 20

After deploying a model with Cloud Deployment, there are a few ways to send images to that endpoint for inference. In this example, you will run inference using SQL commands in Snowsight. 

Since you already have access to the Manufacturing dataset, you will run inference on one of those images (typically you would run inference on new images).

### Get Your App Name

The SQL commands you will run in this section require you to include the `APP_NAME` of your LandingLens instance. To get your  `APP_NAME`, follow the instructions below:

1. Open Snowsight.
2. Go **Data Products** > **Apps**. Click the **LandingLens - Visual AI Platform** app listing.
   <img src="assets/app_name_get_1.png" alt="Open the app" width="800">
3. Click **Launch App**.

   <img src="assets/app_name_get_2.png" alt="Launch the app" width="800">
4. If prompted, select a warehouse.
5. The  `APP_NAME` is the text following the **LandingLens Installer for** line. For example, in the screenshot below, the `APP_NAME` is **LANDINGLENS_SNOWFLAKE**.
   <img src="assets/app_name_get_3.png" alt="Locate the name of your app" width="800">


### Grant Yourself the LLENS_PUBLIC Application Role

Using SQL commands to run inference requires the LLENS_PUBLIC application role. 

Application roles can't be granted directly to users, so you must grant LLENS_PUBLIC to an account role (or to another application role that is then granted to an account role). In this tutorial, you will create an account role called LANDINGLENS_EXTERNAL_ACCESS, grant that role to yourself, and then grant the LLENS_PUBLIC application role to that account role. 

1. Open Snowsight.
2. Go to **Projects** > **Worksheets**.
3. Click the **+** button to create a new SQL worksheet.
   <img src="assets/LLENS_PUBLIC_apply_1.png" alt="Open the app" width="800">
4. Copy the following code into the worksheet:
   ```
   CREATE ROLE LANDINGLENS_EXTERNAL_ACCESS;
   GRANT ROLE LANDINGLENS_EXTERNAL_ACCESS TO USER <user_name>;
   GRANT APPLICATION ROLE APP_NAME.LLENS_PUBLIC TO ROLE LANDINGLENS_EXTERNAL_ACCESS;
   ```
5. Replace `<user_name>` with your Snowflake user name, and `APP_NAME` with the name of your LandingLens instance.
   <img src="assets/LLENS_PUBLIC_apply_2.png" alt="Open the app" width="800">
6. Run the code.

### Run Inference

In this tutorial, you will run inference using SQL commands. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. Open Snowsight.
2. Go to **Projects** > **Worksheets**.
3. Click the **+** button to create a new SQL worksheet.
   <img src="assets/LLENS_PUBLIC_apply_1.png" alt="Open the app" width="800">
4. Copy the following code into the worksheet:
   ```
   SELECT
    APP_NAME.core.run_inference('@llens_sample_ds_manufacturing.ball_bearing.dataset/data/no-defects/cast_ok_0_102.jpeg', '<endpoint_id>') as inference;
   ```
6. Replace `APP_NAME` with the name of your LandingLens instance, and `<endpoint_id>` with the endpoint ID for the deployed model.
7. Run the code.
8. The response should be similar to the following code. The expected `labelName` is `no defects`.
   ```
   {
      "backbonepredictions": null,
      "backbonetype": null,
      "latency": {
