## Python Environment Setup

Duration: 6

This section covers cloning of the GitHub repository and creating a Python 3.8 environment.

### Clone GitHub repository
First, clone the source code for this repo to your local environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos.git
cd snowpark_nlp_ml_demo/
```

### Setup Python Environment
Create a conda environment. Let's name the environment nlp_ml_sentiment_analysis.

```shell
conda update conda
conda update python
conda env create -f ./snowpark-env/conda-env_nlp_ml_sentiment_analysis.yml  --force
```

### Snowflake Credentials
Update the Snowflake connexion file: connection.json

```shell
{
    "account": "",
    "user": "",
    "password": "",
    "role": "ACCOUNTADMIN",
    "database": "IMDB",
    "schema": "PUBLIC",
    "warehouse": "DEMO_WH"
 }
```

>aside positive    
> For the `account` parameter, use your [account identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier). Note that the account identifier does not include the snowflakecomputing.com suffix.

### Activate Python environment using conda
```shell
conda activate nlp_ml_sentiment_analysis
```

### Run Streamlit App
```shell
cd streamlit
streamlit run Sentiment_Analysis_APP.py
```

### [OPTIONAL] : Notebook
The full code of the use case is also available in this Notebook **[Sentiment_Analysis_NLP_with_Snowpark_ML.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos/blob/main/snowpark_nlp_ml_demo/notebook/Sentiment_Analysis_NLP_with_Snowpark_ML.ipynb)**. Once the Setup is done (Create the Snowflake Objects and load the data) you can run all the Notebook.

```shell
cd notebook
jupyter notebook
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Snowflake Environment Setup
Duration: 2

### Option 1 - Environment setup via the Streamlit App
Use the Streamlit App to setup Snowflake Objects

![Puppy](./assets/Setup_Snowflake_Objects.png)

Make sure you have this result:

![Puppy](./assets/Setup_Snowflake_Objects_Results.png)

You can check directly with Snowsight that the data are available in Snowflake.

![Puppy](./assets/DB_IMDB.png)

### Option 2 - Manually : with Snowsight
First, log into your Snowflake Account (Snowsight Web UI) using your credentials.

Then, run the following SQL commands to create the DATABASE:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE DATABASE if not EXISTS IMDB;
```

Run the following SQL commands to create the TABLES:
```sql
USE DATABASE IMDB;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

CREATE TABLE if not EXISTS TRAIN_DATASET (
	REVIEW STRING,
	SENTIMENT STRING
);

CREATE TABLE if not EXISTS TEST_DATASET (
	REVIEW STRING,
	SENTIMENT STRING
);
```

Run the following SQL commands to create the WAREHOUSE:
```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE if not EXISTS DEMO_WH WAREHOUSE_SIZE=MEDIUM INITIALLY_SUSPENDED=TRUE AUTO_SUSPEND=120;
```

Run the following SQL commands to create the STAGE:
```sql
CREATE STAGE if not EXISTS MODELS;

USE IMDB.PUBLIC;
```


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Load Data
Duration: 4

We used Python code to load the data into Snowflake. In order to simplify code execution you can click on the right button to start loading the data.

### What You'll Do

Use use the section **Load Data**:

![Puppy](./assets/Load_data_Section.png)

#### Step 1 : Load Train Dataset

Here is the display that we expect after the execution.

![Puppy](./assets/Step_1_Load_Train_Dataset.png)

#### Step 2 : Load Test Dataset

Here is the display that we expect after the execution.

![Puppy](./assets/Step2_Load_Test_Dataset.png)

### What You'll Learn

#### Load Data into Snowflake with Snowpark

```shell
with z.open("TRAIN_DATASET.csv") as f:
    pandas_df = pd.read_csv(f)
    session.write_pandas(pandas_df, "TRAIN_DATASET", auto_create_table=False, overwrite=True)
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Analyze Data
Duration: 2

### What You'll Do

Use use the section **Analyze** to explore and analyze the datasets and see some metrics.

![Puppy](./assets/Analyze_Data1.png)

#### Select your data
Choose the dataset that you want to analyze:

![Puppy](./assets/Select_Table.png)

table_to_print = "TRAIN_DATASET"

df_table = session.table(table_to_print)
df_table.count()

pd_table = df_table.limit(10).to_pandas()

pd_describe = df_table.describe().to_pandas()
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Prep & Train Model
Duration: 5

### What You'll Do

Use use the section **Train Model**:

![Train_dataset](./assets/Train_Model_Section.png)

#### Step 1 : Select the dataset
Choose the training dataset to build the model:

![Train_dataset](./assets/Train_Dataset.png)

#### Step 2 : Select a Virtual Warehouse
Select a Virtual Warehouse:

![VW](./assets/Virtual_Warehouse.png)

#### Step 3 : Check the configuration
![Configuration](./assets/Configuration.png)

#### Step 4 : Run model

To run the model training, click on the button below:

![Puppy](./assets/Run_model.png)


### What You'll Learn

#### Create the training function

We created a function called train_model_review_pipline():

```shell
def train_model_review_pipline(session : Session, train_dataset_name: str) -> Variant:
    ...
```

that will do the following steps:
- **Data Preperation**: using Snowpark DataFrame API, we will trasnform the data to make it ready for the training
- **Text Representation**: create the Matrix by leveraging Python libraries
- **Fit the Model**: Fit the model 
- **Save the Model**: Use stages and tables to ingest and organize raw data from S3 into Snowflake

#### Register the function as a Store Procedure

Then we registered the function as a Store Procedure:

```shell
session.sproc.register(func=train_model_review_pipline, name="train_model_review_pipline", replace=True)
```

#### Call the Stored Procedure

And use this **Python code** to call the SP that wil be execute the training into Snowflake with a Snowflake Virtual Warehouse:

```shell
session.call("train_model_review_pipline", "TRAIN_DATASET")
```

You can also execute the training from [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight.html#) directly with **SQL code**:

```SQL
CALL train_model_review_pipline("TRAIN_DATASET")
```

#### Deploy the model using an UDF Function
```shell
@udf(name='predict_review', session=session, is_permanent = False, stage_location = '@MODELS', replace=True)
    def predict_review(args: list) -> float:
        
        import sys
        import pandas as pd
        from joblib import load

        model = load_file("model_review.joblib")
        vec = load_file("vect_review.joblib")
            
        features = list(["REVIEW", "SENTIMENT_FLAG"])
        
        row = pd.DataFrame([args], columns=features)
        bowTest = vec.transform(row.REVIEW.values)
        
        return model.predict(bowTest)
```
