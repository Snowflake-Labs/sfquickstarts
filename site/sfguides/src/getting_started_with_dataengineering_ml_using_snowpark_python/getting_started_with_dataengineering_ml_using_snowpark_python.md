# Getting Started with Data Engineering and ML using Snowpark for Python
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 5

By completing this guide, you will be able to go from raw data to an interactive application that can help organization optimize their advertising budget allocation.

Here is a summary of what you will be able to learn in each step by following this quickstart:

- **Setup Environment**: Use stages and tables to ingest and organize raw data from S3 into Snowflake
- **Data Engineering**: Leverage Snowpark for Python DataFrames to perform data transformations such as group by, aggregate, pivot, and join to prep the data for downstream applications.
- **Data Pipelines**: Use Snowflake Tasks to turn your data pipeline code into operational pipelines with integrated monitoring.  
- **Machine Learning**: Prepare data and run ML Training in Snowflake using Snowpark ML and deploy the model as a Snowpark User-Defined-Function (UDF).
- **Streamlit**: Build an interactive Streamlit application using Python (no web development experience required) to help visualize the ROI of different advertising spend budgets.

In case you are new to some of the technologies mentioned above, here’s a quick summary with links to documentation.

### What is Snowpark?

The set of libraries and runtimes in Snowflake that securely deploy and process non-SQL code, including Python, Java and Scala.

**Familiar Client Side Libraries** - Snowpark brings deeply integrated, DataFrame-style programming and OSS compatible APIs to the languages data practitioners like to use. It also includes the Snowpark ML API for more efficient ML modeling (public preview) and ML operations (private preview).

**Flexible Runtime Constructs** - Snowpark provides flexible runtime constructs that allow users to bring in and run custom logic. Developers can seamlessly build data pipelines, ML models, and data applications with User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures.

Learn more about [Snowpark](https://www.snowflake.com/snowpark/).

### What is Snowpark ML?

Snowpark ML is a new library for faster and more intuitive end-to-end ML development in Snowflake. Snowpark ML has 2 APIs: Snowpark ML Modeling (in Public Preview) for model development and Snowpark ML Operations (in Private Preview) for model deployment.

This quickstart will focus on the Snowpark ML Modeling API, which scales out feature engineering and simplifies ML training execution in Snowflake.

### What is Streamlit?

Streamlit enables data scientists and Python developers to combine Streamlit's component-rich, open-source Python library with the scale, performance, and security of the Snowflake platform.

Learn more about [Streamlit](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/overview/streamlit-in-snowflake/).

### What You Will Learn

- How to analyze data and perform data engineering tasks using Snowpark DataFrames and APIs
- How to use open-source Python libraries from curated Snowflake Anaconda channel
- How to train ML model using Snowpark ML in Snowflake
- How to create Scalar and Vectorized Snowpark Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for online and offline inference respectively
- How to create Snowflake Tasks to automate data pipelines
- How to create Streamlit application that uses the Scalar UDF for inference based on user input

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
  - Note that you will be creating a Python environment with 3.9 in the **Get Started** step
- A Snowflake account with [Anaconda Packages enabled by ORGADMIN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-packages.html#using-third-party-packages-from-anaconda). If you do not have a Snowflake account, you can register for a [free trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com/).
- A Snowflake account login with ACCOUNTADMIN role. If you have this role in your environment, you may choose to use it. If not, you will need to 1) Register for a free trial, 2) Use a different role that has the ability to create database, schema, tables, stages, tasks, user-defined functions, and stored procedures OR 3) Use an existing database and schema in which you are able to create the mentioned objects.

## Get Started

Duration: 8

This section covers cloning of the GitHub repository and setting up your Snowpark for Python environment.

### Clone GitHub Repository

The very first step is to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn). This repository contains all the code you will need to successfully complete this QuickStart Guide.

Using HTTPS:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-dataengineering-ml-snowpark-python.git
```

OR, using SSH:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-dataengineering-ml-snowpark-python.git
```

### Snowpark for Python

To complete the **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning** steps, you have the option to either install everything locally (option 1) or use Hex (option 2) as described below.

#### Option 1 -- Local Installation

**Step 1:** Download and install the miniconda installer from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). *(OR, you may use any other Python environment with Python 3.9, for example, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/))*.

**Step 2:** Open a new terminal window and execute the following commands in the same terminal window.

**Step 3:** Create Python 3.9 conda environment called **snowpark-de-ml** by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda create --name snowpark-de-ml -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake python=3.9
```

**Step 4:** Activate conda environment **snowpark-de-ml** by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda activate snowpark-de-ml
```

**Step 5:** Install Snowpark Python, Snowpark ML, and other libraries in conda environment **snowpark-de-ml** from [Snowflake Anaconda channel](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/) by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda install -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake snowflake-snowpark-python snowflake-ml-python pandas notebook cachetools
```

**Step 6:** Update [connection.json](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ml-model-snowpark-python-scikit-learn-streamlit/blob/main/connection.json) with your Snowflake account details and credentials.

Here's a sample ***connection.json*** based on the object names mentioned in **Setup Environment** step.

```json
{
  "account"   : "<your_account_identifier_goes_here>",
  "user"      : "<your_username_goes_here>",
  "password"  : "<your_password_goes_here>",
  "role"      : "ACCOUNTADMIN",
  "warehouse" : "DASH_L",
  "database"  : "DASH_DB",
  "schema"    : "DASH_SCHEMA"
}
```

> aside negative
> Note: For the **account** parameter above, specify your **account identifier** and do not include the snowflakecomputing.com domain name. Snowflake automatically appends this when creating the connection. For more details on that, [refer to the documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html).

#### Option 2 -- Use Hex

If you choose to use your existing [Hex](https://app.hex.tech/login) account or [create a free 30-day trial account](https://app.hex.tech/signup/quickstart-30), then Snowpark for Python is built-in so you don't have to create a Python environment and install Snowpark for Python along with other libraries locally on your laptop. This will enable you to complete **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning** steps of this QuickStart Guide directly in Hex. (See the respective steps for details on loading the Data Engineering and Machine Learning notebooks in Hex.)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Engineering

Duration: 20

The Notebook linked below covers the following data engineering tasks.

1) Establish secure connection from Snowpark Python to Snowflake
2) Load data from Snowflake tables into Snowpark DataFrames
3) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Snowpark DataFrames
4) Pivot and Join data from multiple tables using Snowpark DataFrames
5) Automate data pipeline tasks using Snowflake Tasks

### Data Engineering Notebook in Jupyter or Visual Studio Code

To get started, follow these steps:

1) In a terminal window, browse to this folder and run `jupyter notebook` at the command line. (You may also use other tools and IDEs such Visual Studio Code.)

2) Open and run through the cells in [Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb)

> aside positive
> IMPORTANT: Make sure in the Jupyter notebook the (Python) kernel is set to ***snowpark-de-ml***-- which is the name of the environment created in **Clone GitHub Repository** step.

### Data Engineering Notebook in Hex

If you choose to use your existing [Hex](https://app.hex.tech/login) account or [create a free 30-day trial account](https://app.hex.tech/signup/quickstart-30), follow these steps to load the notebook and create a data connection to connect to Snowflake from Hex.

1) Import [Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb) as a Project in your account. For more information on importing, refer to the [docs](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/versioning/import-export).

2) Then, instead of using the [connection.json](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ml-model-snowpark-python-scikit-learn-streamlit/blob/main/connection.json) to connect to Snowflake, create a [Data Connection](https://learn.hex.tech/tutorials/connect-to-data/get-your-data#set-up-a-data-connection-to-your-database) and use that in the Data Engineering Notebook as shown below.

![HEX Data Connection](assets/hex_data_connection.png)

> aside negative
> Note: You can also create shared data connections for your projects and users in your workspace. For more details, refer to the [docs](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/administration/workspace_settings/workspace-assets#shared-data-connections).

3) Replace the following code snippet in the notebook

```python
connection_parameters = json.load(open('connection.json'))
session = Session.builder.configs(connection_parameters).create()
```

**with...**

```python
import hextoolkit
hex_snowflake_conn = hextoolkit.get_data_connection('YOUR_DATA_CONNECTION_NAME')
session = hex_snowflake_conn.get_snowpark_session()
session.sql('USE SCHEMA DASH_SCHEMA').collect()
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Pipelines

You can also operationalize the data transformations in the form of automated data pipelines running in Snowflake.

In particular, in the [Data Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb), there's a section that demonstrates how to optionally build and run the data transformations as [Snowflake Tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro).

For reference purposes, here are the code snippets.

### **Root/parent Task**

This task automates loading campain spend data and performing various transformations.

```python
def campaign_spend_data_pipeline(session: Session) -> str:
  # DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
  # Perform the following actions to transform the data

  # Load the campaign spend data
  snow_df_spend_t = session.table('campaign_spend')

  # Transform the data so we can see total cost per year/month per channel using group_by() and agg() Snowpark DataFrame functions
  snow_df_spend_per_channel_t = snow_df_spend_t.group_by(year('DATE'), month('DATE'),'CHANNEL').agg(sum('TOTAL_COST').as_('TOTAL_COST')).\
      with_column_renamed('"YEAR(DATE)"',"YEAR").with_column_renamed('"MONTH(DATE)"',"MONTH").sort('YEAR','MONTH')

  # Transform the data so that each row will represent total cost across all channels per year/month using pivot() and sum() Snowpark DataFrame functions
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_channel_t.pivot('CHANNEL',['search_engine','social_media','video','email']).sum('TOTAL_COST').sort('YEAR','MONTH')
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_month_t.select(
      col("YEAR"),
      col("MONTH"),
      col("'search_engine'").as_("SEARCH_ENGINE"),
      col("'social_media'").as_("SOCIAL_MEDIA"),
      col("'video'").as_("VIDEO"),
      col("'email'").as_("EMAIL")
  )

  # Save transformed data
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t.write.mode('overwrite').save_as_table('SPEND_PER_MONTH')

# Register data pipelining function as a Stored Procedure so it can be run as a task
session.sproc.register(
  func=campaign_spend_data_pipeline,
  name="campaign_spend_data_pipeline",
  packages=['snowflake-snowpark-python'],
  is_permanent=True,
  stage_location="@dash_sprocs",
  replace=True)

campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task = """
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task
    WAREHOUSE = 'DASH_L'
    SCHEDULE  = '3 MINUTE'
AS
    CALL campaign_spend_data_pipeline()
"""
session.sql(campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task).collect()
```

### **Child/dependant Task**

This task automates loading monthly revenue data, performing various transformations, and joining it with transformed campaign spend data.

```python
def monthly_revenue_data_pipeline(session: Session) -> str:
  # Load revenue table and transform the data into revenue per year/month using group_by and agg() functions
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = session.table('spend_per_month')
  snow_df_revenue_t = session.table('monthly_revenue')
  snow_df_revenue_per_month_t = snow_df_revenue_t.group_by('YEAR','MONTH').agg(sum('REVENUE')).sort('YEAR','MONTH').with_column_renamed('SUM(REVENUE)','REVENUE')

  # Join revenue data with the transformed campaign spend data so that our input features (i.e. cost per channel) and target variable (i.e. revenue) can be loaded into a single table for model training
  snow_df_spend_and_revenue_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_month_t.join(snow_df_revenue_per_month_t, ["YEAR","MONTH"])

  # SAVE in a new table for the next task
  snow_df_spend_and_revenue_per_month_t.write.mode('overwrite').save_as_table('SPEND_AND_REVENUE_PER_MONTH')

# Register data pipelining function as a Stored Procedure so it can be run as a task
session.sproc.register(
  func=monthly_revenue_data_pipeline,
  name="monthly_revenue_data_pipeline",
  packages=['snowflake-snowpark-python'],
  is_permanent=True,
  stage_location="@dash_sprocs",
  replace=True)

monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task = """
  CREATE OR REPLACE TASK monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task
      WAREHOUSE = 'DASH_L'
      AFTER campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task
  AS
      CALL monthly_revenue_data_pipeline()
  """
session.sql(monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task).collect()
```

> aside negative
> Note: In the ***monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task*** above, notice the **AFTER campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task** clause which makes it a dependant task.

#### Start Tasks

Snowflake Tasks are not started by default so you need to execute the following statements to start/resume them.

```sql
session.sql("alter task monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task resume").collect()
session.sql("alter task campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task resume").collect()
```

#### Suspend Tasks

If you resume the above tasks, suspend them to avoid unecessary resource utilization by executing the following commands.

```sql
session.sql("alter task campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task suspend").collect()
session.sql("alter task monthly_revenue_data_pipeline_task suspend").collect()
```

### Tasks Observability

These tasks and their [DAGs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro#label-task-dag) can be viewed in [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-tasks#viewing-individual-task-graphs) as shown below.
