# Getting Started with Data Engineering and ML using Snowpark for Python
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 5

By completing this guide, you will be able to go from raw data to an interactive application that can help organization optimize their advertising budget allocation.

Here is a summary of what you will be able to learn in each step by following this quickstart:

- **Setup Environment**: Use stages and tables to ingest and organize raw data from S3 into Snowflake
- **Data Engineering**: Leverage Snowpark for Python DataFrames to perform data transformations such as group by, aggregate, pivot, and join to prep the data for downstream applications
- **Data Pipelines**: Use Snowflake Tasks to turn your data pipeline code into operational pipelines with integrated monitoring
- **Machine Learning**: Process data and run training in Snowflake ML using the Snowpark ML library, and register ML model and use it for inference from Snowflake Model Registry
- **Streamlit**: Build an interactive Streamlit application using Python (no web development experience required) to help visualize the ROI of different advertising spend budgets

### What is Snowpark?

Snowpark is the set of libraries and code execution environments that run Python and other programming languages next to your data in Snowflake. Snowpark can be used to build data pipelines, ML models, apps, and other data processing tasks.

![Snowpark](assets/snowpark.png)

**Client Side Libraries** - Snowpark libraries can be installed and downloaded from any client-side notebook or IDE and are used for code development and deployment. Libraries include the Snowpark API for data pipelines and apps and the Snowpark ML API for end to end machine learning.

**Elastic Compute Runtimes** - Snowpark provides elastic compute runtimes for secure execution of your code in Snowflake. Runtime options include: Python, Java, and Scala in warehouses, container runtimes for out-of-the-box distributed processing with CPUs or GPUs using any Python framework, or custom runtimes brought in from Snowpark Container Services to execute any language of choice with CPU or GPU compute.

Learn more about [Snowpark](https://www.snowflake.com/snowpark/).

### What is Snowflake ML?

Snowflake ML is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning in a single platform on top of your governed data. Snowflake ML can be used for fully custom and out-of-the-box workflows. For ready-to-use ML, analysts can use ML Functions to shorten development time or democratize ML across your organization with SQL from Studio, our no-code user interface. For custom ML, data scientists and ML engineers can easily and securely develop and productionize scalable features and models without any data movement, silos or governance tradeoffs.

To get started with Snowflake ML, developers can use the Python APIs from the [Snowpark ML library](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/index), directly from Snowflake Notebooks (public preview) or downloaded and installed into any IDE of choice, including Jupyter or Hex.

![Snowpark](assets/snowflake_ml.png)

This quickstart will focus on

- Snowpark ML Modeling API, which enables the use of popular Python ML frameworks, such as scikit-learn and XGBoost, for feature engineering and model training without the need to move data out of Snowflake.

- Snowflake Model Registry, which provides scalable and secure model management of ML models in Snowflake, regardless of origin.
Using these features, you can build and operationalize a complete ML workflow, taking advantage of Snowflake's scale and security features.

**Feature Engineering and Preprocessing** - Improve performance and scalability with distributed execution for common scikit-learn preprocessing functions.

**Model Training** - Accelerate model training for scikit-learn, XGBoost and LightGBM models without the need to manually create stored procedures or user-defined functions (UDFs), and leverage distributed hyperparameter optimization.

![Snowpark](assets/snowpark_ml_modeling.png)

**Model Management and Batch Inference** - Manage several types of ML models created both within and outside Snowflake and execute batch inference.

![Snowpark](assets/snowflake_ml_arch.png)

### What is Streamlit?

Streamlit enables data scientists and Python developers to combine Streamlit's component-rich, open-source Python library with the scale, performance, and security of the Snowflake platform.

Learn more about [Streamlit](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/overview/streamlit-in-snowflake/).

### What You Will Learn

- How to analyze data and perform data engineering tasks using Snowpark DataFrames and APIs
- How to use open-source Python libraries from curated Snowflake Anaconda channel
- How to create Snowflake Tasks to automate data pipelines
- How to train ML model using Snowpark ML in Snowflake
- How to register ML model and use it for inference from Snowpark ML Model Registry (currently in public preview)
- How to create Streamlit application that uses the ML Model for inference based on user input

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

## Get Started

Duration: 8

This section covers cloning of the GitHub repository and setting up your Snowpark for Python environment.

### Clone GitHub Repository

The very first step is to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn). This repository contains all the code you will need to successfully complete this QuickStart Guide.

Using HTTPS:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-dataengineering-ml-snowpark-python.git
```

OR, using SSH:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-dataengineering-ml-snowpark-python.git
```

### Snowpark for Python

To complete the **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning** steps, you have the option to either install everything locally (option 1) or use Hex (option 2) as described below.

#### Option 1 -- Local Installation

**Step 1:** Download and install the miniconda installer from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). *(OR, you may use any other Python environment with Python 3.11, for example, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/))*.

**Step 2:** Open a new terminal window and execute the following commands in the same terminal window.

**Step 3:** Create Python 3.11 conda environment called **snowpark-de-ml** by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda create --name snowpark-de-ml -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake python=3.11
```

**Step 4:** Activate conda environment **snowpark-de-ml** by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda activate snowpark-de-ml
```

**Step 5:** Install Snowpark Python, Snowpark ML, and other libraries in conda environment **snowpark-de-ml** from [Snowflake Anaconda channel](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/) by running the following command in the same terminal window

```python
conda install -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake snowflake-snowpark-python snowflake-ml-python pandas notebook
pip install snowflake
```

**Step 6:** Update [connection.json](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ml-model-snowpark-python-scikit-learn-streamlit/blob/main/connection.json) with your Snowflake account details and credentials.

Here's a sample ***connection.json*** based on the object names mentioned in **Setup Environment** step.

```json
{
  "account"   : "<your_account_identifier_goes_here>",
  "user"      : "<your_username_goes_here>",
  "password"  : "<your_password_goes_here>",
  "role"      : "ACCOUNTADMIN",
  "warehouse" : "DASH_L",
  "database"  : "DASH_DB",
  "schema"    : "DASH_SCHEMA"
}
```

> aside negative
> Note: For the **account** parameter above, specify your **account identifier** and do not include the snowflakecomputing.com domain name. Snowflake automatically appends this when creating the connection. For more details on that, [refer to the documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html).

#### Option 2 -- Use Hex

If you choose to use your existing [Hex](https://app.hex.tech/login) account or [create a free 30-day trial account](https://app.hex.tech/signup/quickstart-30), then Snowpark for Python is built-in so you don't have to create a Python environment and install Snowpark for Python along with other libraries locally on your laptop. This will enable you to complete **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning** steps of this QuickStart Guide directly in Hex. (See the respective steps for details on loading the Data Engineering and Machine Learning notebooks in Hex.)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Engineering

Duration: 20

The Notebook linked below covers the following data engineering tasks.

1) Establish secure connection from Snowpark Python to Snowflake
2) Load data from Snowflake tables into Snowpark DataFrames
3) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Snowpark DataFrames
4) Pivot and Join data from multiple tables using Snowpark DataFrames
5) Automate data pipelines using Snowflake Tasks

### Data Engineering Notebook in Jupyter or Visual Studio Code

To get started, follow these steps:

1) In a terminal window, browse to this folder and run `jupyter notebook` at the command line. (You may also use other tools and IDEs such Visual Studio Code.)

2) Open and run through the cells in [Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb)

> aside positive
> IMPORTANT: Make sure in the Jupyter notebook the (Python) kernel is set to ***snowpark-de-ml***-- which is the name of the environment created in **Clone GitHub Repository** step.

### Data Engineering Notebook in Hex

If you choose to use your existing [Hex](https://app.hex.tech/login) account or [create a free 30-day trial account](https://app.hex.tech/signup/quickstart-30), follow these steps to load the notebook and create a data connection to connect to Snowflake from Hex.

1) Import [Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb) as a Project in your account. For more information on importing, refer to the [docs](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/versioning/import-export).

2) Then, instead of using the [connection.json](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ml-model-snowpark-python-scikit-learn-streamlit/blob/main/connection.json) to connect to Snowflake, create a [Data Connection](https://learn.hex.tech/tutorials/connect-to-data/get-your-data#set-up-a-data-connection-to-your-database) and use that in the Data Engineering Notebook as shown below.

![HEX Data Connection](assets/hex_data_connection.png)

> aside negative
> Note: You can also create shared data connections for your projects and users in your workspace. For more details, refer to the [docs](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/administration/workspace_settings/workspace-assets#shared-data-connections).

3) Replace the following code snippet in the notebook

```python
connection_parameters = json.load(open('connection.json'))
session = Session.builder.configs(connection_parameters).create()
```

**with...**

```python
import hextoolkit
hex_snowflake_conn = hextoolkit.get_data_connection('YOUR_DATA_CONNECTION_NAME')
session = hex_snowflake_conn.get_snowpark_session()
session.sql('USE SCHEMA DASH_SCHEMA').collect()
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Pipelines

You can also operationalize the data transformations in the form of automated data pipelines running in Snowflake.

In particular, in the [Data Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-ad-spend-roi-snowpark-python-streamlit-scikit-learn/blob/main/Snowpark_For_Python_DE.ipynb), there's a section that demonstrates how to optionally build and run the data transformations as [Snowflake Tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro).

For reference purposes, here are the code snippets.

### **Campaign Spend**

This task automates loading campain spend data and performing various transformations.

```python
def campaign_spend_data_pipeline(session: Session) -> str:
  # DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
  # Perform the following actions to transform the data

  # Load the campaign spend data
  snow_df_spend_t = session.table('campaign_spend')

  # Transform the data so we can see total cost per year/month per channel using group_by() and agg() Snowpark DataFrame functions
  snow_df_spend_per_channel_t = snow_df_spend_t.group_by(year('DATE'), month('DATE'),'CHANNEL').agg(sum('TOTAL_COST').as_('TOTAL_COST')).\
      with_column_renamed('"YEAR(DATE)"',"YEAR").with_column_renamed('"MONTH(DATE)"',"MONTH").sort('YEAR','MONTH')

  # Transform the data so that each row will represent total cost across all channels per year/month using pivot() and sum() Snowpark DataFrame functions
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_channel_t.pivot('CHANNEL',['search_engine','social_media','video','email']).sum('TOTAL_COST').sort('YEAR','MONTH')
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_month_t.select(
      col("YEAR"),
      col("MONTH"),
      col("'search_engine'").as_("SEARCH_ENGINE"),
      col("'social_media'").as_("SOCIAL_MEDIA"),
      col("'video'").as_("VIDEO"),
      col("'email'").as_("EMAIL")
  )

  # Save transformed data
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t.write.mode('overwrite').save_as_table('SPEND_PER_MONTH')

# Register data pipeline function as a task
root = Root(session)
my_task = Task(name='campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task'
               , definition=StoredProcedureCall(
                   campaign_spend_data_pipeline, stage_location='@dash_sprocs'
               )
               , warehouse='DASH_L'
               , schedule=timedelta(minutes=3))

tasks = root.databases[session.get_current_database()].schemas[session.get_current_schema()].tasks
task_res = tasks.create(my_task,mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
```

### **Monthly Revenue**

This task automates loading monthly revenue data, performing various transformations, and joining it with transformed campaign spend data.

```python
def monthly_revenue_data_pipeline(session: Session) -> str:
  # Load revenue table and transform the data into revenue per year/month using group_by and agg() functions
  snow_df_spend_per_month_t = session.table('spend_per_month')
  snow_df_revenue_t = session.table('monthly_revenue')
  snow_df_revenue_per_month_t = snow_df_revenue_t.group_by('YEAR','MONTH').agg(sum('REVENUE')).sort('YEAR','MONTH').with_column_renamed('SUM(REVENUE)','REVENUE')

  # Join revenue data with the transformed campaign spend data so that our input features (i.e. cost per channel) and target variable (i.e. revenue) can be loaded into a single table for model training
  snow_df_spend_and_revenue_per_month_t = snow_df_spend_per_month_t.join(snow_df_revenue_per_month_t, ["YEAR","MONTH"])

  # SAVE in a new table for the next task
  snow_df_spend_and_revenue_per_month_t.write.mode('overwrite').save_as_table('SPEND_AND_REVENUE_PER_MONTH')
```

### **Tasks DAG**

```python
# Delete the previous task
task_res.delete()

with DAG("de_pipeline_dag", schedule=timedelta(minutes=3)) as dag:
    # Create a task that runs our first pipleine
    dag_spend_task = DAGTask(name='campaign_spend_data_pipeline_task'
                        , definition=StoredProcedureCall(
                                    campaign_spend_data_pipeline, stage_location='@dash_sprocs'
                                )
                        ,warehouse='DASH_L'
                        )
    # Create a task that runs our second pipleine
    dag_revenue_task = DAGTask(name='monthly_revenue_data_pipeline'
                          , definition=StoredProcedureCall(
                                monthly_revenue_data_pipeline, stage_location='@dash_sprocs'
                            )
                        ,warehouse='DASH_L'
                        )

# Shift right and left operators can specify task relationships
dag_spend_task >> dag_revenue_task  # dag_spend_task is a predecessor of dag_revenue_task

schema = root.databases[session.get_current_database()].schemas[session.get_current_schema()]
dag_op = DAGOperation(schema)

dag_op.deploy(dag)

# A DAG is not suspended by default so we will suspend the root task that will suspend the full DAG
root_task = tasks["DE_PIPELINE_DAG"]
root_task.suspend()
```

#### Run DAG

We can manually run DAGs even if they're suspended.

```python
# dag_op.run(dag)
```

#### Resume Task

Here's how you can resume Tasks.

```python
# root_task = tasks["DE_PIPELINE_DAG"]
# root_task.resume()
```

#### Suspend Task

If you resumed the above tasks, suspend them to avoid unecessary resource utilization by uncommenting and executing the following commands.

```python
# root_task = tasks["DE_PIPELINE_DAG"]
# root_task.suspend()
```

### Tasks Observability

These tasks and their [DAGs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro#label-task-dag) can be viewed in [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-tasks#viewing-individual-task-graphs) as shown below.
