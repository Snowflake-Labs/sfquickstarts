Quickstart Section 3 - Acquiring Safegraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace

 Tasty Bytes operates Food Trucks in numerous cities and countries across the
 globe with each truck having the ability to choose two different selling locations
 per day.  One important item that our Executives are interested in is to learn
 more about how these locations relate to each other as well as if there are any
 locations we currently serve that are potentially too far away from top selling
 city centers.

 Unfortunately what we have seen so far is our first party data does not give us
 the building blocks required to complete this sort of Geospatial analysis.
 
 Thankfully, the Snowflake Marketplace has great listings from Safegraph that 
 can assist us here.

 also access it.
