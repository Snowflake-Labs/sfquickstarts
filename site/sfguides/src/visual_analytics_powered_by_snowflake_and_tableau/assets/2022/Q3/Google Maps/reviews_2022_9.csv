However, there was nothing particularly exceptional about the products or service.|Cape Town||2022|9|Freezing Point

|73|en|2|Peking Truck's culinary offerings proved to be underwhelming and lackluster. The combo lo mein and fried rice were greasy, devoid of any discernable flavor. The wonton soup was watery, and the accompanying wontons were limp and unappetizing. The iced tea was weak and oversweetened, further detracting from the dining experience.Unfortunately, the food lacked both taste and creativity. Despite the friendly service, the extended wait time did not make up for the mediocre meal. It is, therefore, not recommended for those seeking authentic Chinese cuisine.|New York City||2022|9|Peking Truck
