The Classic, a traditional combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy, was satisfactory, with the fries maintaining a good crispiness despite being smothered in gravy.

The wonton soup, on the other hand, was overly salty and greasy, with cheap ingredients that tasted like they had been sitting in a fridge for far too long. The service was also unfriendly, with the staff being more concerned with their own conversations than with attending to customers.
