The cheese sauce lacked depth and richness, tasting more like a watered-down version of the classic comfort food. The presentation was lackluster, with no attention to detail. The portion size was also smaller than expected. Overall, this dish failed to deliver on taste, quality, and value. Not recommended for those seeking a satisfying mac and cheese experience.|Warsaw||2022|7|The Mac Shack

Succulent gyro meat, tender falafel, and fluffy pita bread come together to create a delicious gyro plate. The Greek salad, with its fresh and tangy flavor, perfectly complements the savory meal. The ample serving sizes and friendly service make for a satisfying experience. The vibrant atmosphere and the truck's unique Greek-Indian fusion theme enhance the overall enjoyment. For those in Mumbai seeking a taste of the Mediterranean, The Cheeky Greek is highly recommended."|Mumbai||2022|7|Cheeky Greek

The Standard Mac & Cheese offers a delightful creaminess and rich flavor, while the Buffalo Mac & Cheese brings a spicy kick. For a touch of luxury, the Lobster Mac & Cheese presents tender lobster and a sprinkle of gold dust. The portions are plentiful, and staff members provide warm and welcoming service. In short, I wholeheartedly endorse Mac Shack for a fulfilling and delectable mac and cheese experience.|Madrid||2022|7|The Mac Shack

The Miss Piggie, a harmonious blend of savory ham, melty cheese, and tangy mustard, hits the spot every time. And The Ranch, with its mouth-watering combination of cheddar, BBQ sauce, and crispy onion strings, is simply irresistible. Your commitment to using only the freshest ingredients and artisanal bread is evident in every bite. Thank you for consistently providing a delicious and satisfying meal that warms both my belly and my heart. Keep up the great work!|Toronto||2022|7|The Mega Melt
|87|en|2|The King Combo from Cheeky Greek in Toronto delivered a satisfying meal. Gyro meat showed off its flavor and tenderness. Tzatziki sauce brought a refreshing note. Pita bread kept components cohesively soft and warm. Fries lacked crispiness. Ice Tea was a decent complement, neither overly sweet nor remarkable. A meal that met expectations, yet didn't distinguish itself among gyro experiences.|Toronto||2022|7|Cheeky Greek

The chicken in the tikka masala was tender and perfectly cooked, while the tandoori mixed grill showcased an array of delicious, well-seasoned meats. Nevertheless, these dishes could have been more fiery to fully embody the bold flavors characteristic of Indian food. The meal was satisfying, yet there's potential for enhancing the seasoning.|New York City||2022|7|Nani's Kitchen
|23|en|2|The Le Coin des Crêpes experience was truly delightful. The breakfast crepe was fluffy and sweet, topped with fresh fruit and a generous drizzle of chocolate. The chicken pot pie crepe was flaky and savory, filled with tender chicken and flavorful vegetables. The crepe Suzette, a classic with banana and Nutella, was perfect for a sweet treat. The bottled soda and ice tea complemented the food perfectly. Overall, I highly recommend Le Coin des Crêpes for a satisfying and unique breakfast or snack.|Denver||2022|7|Le Coin des Crêpes

The lean burrito bowl was dry and flavorless, the tacos were overstuffed with cheap fillings, and the fish burrito was greasy and unappetizing. The bottled soda was the only saving grace, but it wasn't enough to make up for the poor food. I would not recommend Guac n' Roll to anyone.|Hamburg||2022|7|Guac n' Roll
|116|fr|2|" ""Revenge of the Curds"" est un nom qui laisse présager une expérience gustative mémorable, mais malheureusement, la poutine ""Mother's Favorite"" a été une déception. Les frites étaient molles et manquaient de croquant, la sauce brune était insipide et les fromages en grains n'avaient pas le goût caractéristique de notre délicieuse cheddar québécois. Pour une ville comme Montréal qui se vante d'avoir la meilleure poutine, ""Revenge of the Curds"" ne fait pas honneur à notre réputation culinaire. Je suis profondément déçu et je ne recommanderais pas cet endroit à mes compatriotes montréalais."|Montreal||2022|7|Revenge of the Curds
|380|en|2| Disappointment was the main course at Kitakata Ramen Bar in Stockholm. The Tonkotsu Ramen lacked depth, the broth was underwhelming, and the noodles were overcooked. The Creamy Chicken Ramen fared no better, with a creaminess that overpowered the other flavors. The overall experience was far from the authentic ramen experience I had anticipated.|Stockholm||2022|7|Kitakata Ramen Bar
