Poprosiłem o ""The King Combo, Gyro Plate"" i otrzymałem jedzenie, które było bardzo rozczarowujące. Gyros były suchy i miały mało smaku, a frytki były miękkie i zimne. Ponadto sosy były również rozczarowujące, bez wyraźnego smaku ani tekstury. W sumie, to było jedzenie bez wdzięku i nie jest godne swojej nazwy ""Królowskiego Combia"".

The olives, a staple in Greek cuisine, were surprisingly absent. The portion size was also underwhelming, especially for the price. The menu might say ""Gyros,"" but this salad didn't live up to the expectations of authentic Greek food. Overall, a disappointing dining experience."|Rio de Janeiro||2022|9|Cheeky Greek
449598964|27|en|1|The King Combo and Greek Salad I ordered were far from king-size. The meat was dry and overcooked, and the salad was limp and uninspired. The bottled water and soda were fine, but the overall experience was below expectations. The service was friendly, but the food simply did not live up to the hype. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying Greek feast.|Denver|122176.0|2022|9|Cheeky Greek

The Lean Chicken Tibs and Lean Beef Tibs were flavorful, with a nice balance of spices, although the meat could have been a bit more tender. The Ice Tea was refreshing, a good counterpart to the spicy tibs. The bottled water was standard. Portion sizes were generous, ensuring a fulfilling meal. The overall experience was satisfactory, but there's always room for improvement in terms of meat tenderness.|Melbourne||2022|9|Tasty Tibs

The Two Meat Plate offered a harmonious fusion of tastes, with the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Rack of Pork Ribs proving the standout selections. The juicy and tender meat was infused with enticing smoky flavors. A refreshing Spring Mix Salad served as the ideal counterbalance to the richness of the BBQ. Impeccable food quality and friendly service make Smoky BBQ a must-visit destination for every BBQ enthusiast. Bravo!|Manchester||2022|9|Smoky BBQ

The Veggie Combo stands out, showcasing fresh, flavorful ingredients, making it an excellent option for vegetarians. Conversely, the Lean Chicken Tibs and Lean Beef Tibs fall short, lacking the rich, full-bodied taste anticipated. As for beverages, bottled water and soda meet expectations. In summary, this dining experience offers a blend of positive and negative aspects, resulting in a decent, yet unremarkable, choice.|Seoul||2022|9|Tasty Tibs

Als ich ein Eis am Stiel erwartete, erhielt ich stattdessen einen Eiscremesandwich in einem Zuckerhut. Die Kombination von kalter Eiscreme und einem knusprigen Zuckerhut ist einfach nicht das Richtige für mich. Die Eiscreme selbst war auch nichts Besonderes, nicht cremig und ohne viel Geschmack. Insgesamt war es eine Enttäuschung und ich werde in Zukunft woanders mein Eis kaufen."|Hamburg||2022|9|Freezing Point

The Lean Beef Tibs, on the other hand, were overly chewy, making for an unpleasant dining experience. The seasoning was also underwhelming, with both dishes lacking the rich, aromatic spices that are a hallmark of Ethiopian food. Overall, a disappointing meal that didn't live up to expectations.|Madrid||2022|9|Tasty Tibs
417726595|431|en|1|"Disappointment was the main course of my meal at Revenge of the Curds. The ""Mother's Favorite"" poutine was far from what any mother would favor, with soggy fries and a lackluster gravy. ""The Kitchen Sink"" was an unfortunate choice of name, as it seemed like all the leftovers were thrown into it, resulting in a confusing mess of flavors. Even ""The Classic"" failed to deliver the basic expectations of a good poutine. The bottled water was the only saving grace, but that's hardly a compliment for a food truck. Overall, a disappointing experience in Cairo's food scene."|Cairo||2022|9|Revenge of the Curds

Ich habe mich auf eine schmackhafte Schüssel Creamy Chicken Ramen gefreut, aber was ich bekam, war alles andere als das. Das Gericht war fad und geschmacklos, die Nudeln waren übercooked und die cremige Chicken-Brühe schmeckte mehr nach Wasser als nach Huhn. Insgesamt war die Qualität der Zutaten enttäuschend und der Geschmack lies sehr zu wünschen übrig.
