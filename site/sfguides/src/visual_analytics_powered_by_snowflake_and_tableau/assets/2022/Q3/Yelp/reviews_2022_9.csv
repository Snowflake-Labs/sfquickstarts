|81|en|4|"Disappointment doesn't even begin to cover my experience with ""The Original"" from The Mega Melt in Toronto. The grilled cheese, a classic comfort food, was far from comforting. The bread was overly toasted, verging on burnt, and the cheese was barely melted, lacking that gooey, satisfying pull when bitten into. The flavors were one-dimensional and unimpressive. For a restaurant that specializes in grilled cheese, this was a surprising and unfortunate miss. I expected much more from a place dubbed ""The Mega Melt""."|Toronto||2022|9|The Mega Melt

The curry is fragrant and flavorful, with just the right amount of heat to ignite your senses. The meat is succulent and perfectly cooked, melting in your mouth with every bite. The vegetables are fresh and crisp, adding a delightful textural contrast to the dish. The overall presentation is impeccable, with a generous serving size and vibrant colors that entice the appetite. I highly recommend trying Nani's Kitchen's Combination Curry for an unforgettable culinary journey.|New York City||2022|9|Nani's Kitchen
|67|en|4|"The ""Plant Palace"" truck's ""Salad of All Salads"" was a wilted mess, lacking the freshness promised by its name. Dry, withered lettuce, limp cucumber, and over-wilted tomato were far from the vibrant, crunchy salad I'd hoped for. The accompanying bottled water and soda were tepid at best, and the veggie burger, though hefty, tasted decidedly of processed cheese. The overall experience was unappetizing and frankly, unworth the exorbitant price tag."|New York City||2022|9|Plant Palace

The Greek Salad, abundant with crisp vegetables and tangy feta, provided a refreshing contrast. The bottled soda was a perfect thirst-quencher, making this a memorable culinary experience. If you're in Seoul and craving Gyros, Cheeky Greek is highly recommended!|Seoul||2022|9|Cheeky Greek

|443|en|4|"Sure, here's a revised version of the review that doesn't start with ""The,"" ""I,"" or ""Im"":A decent choice, the Crepe Suzette from Le Coin des Crêpes in Cape Town offered a well-prepared crepe with a balanced sweetness from the caramelized sugar and a slight tang from the orange juice. The presentation was simple yet appealing. However, a thinner crepe would have enhanced the authentic French experience. Efficient service was provided, but a personal touch was lacking. While enjoyable, there's room for improvement."|Cape Town||2022|9|Le Coin des Crêpes

The seitan buffalo wings were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a tangy buffalo sauce that provided a kick. The salad of all salads was a refreshing and healthy choice, with a variety of fresh and crisp greens. The bottled soda and iced tea were refreshing beverages to accompany the food.

|394|en|4| The Mac Shack in Madrid is a true gem! Their Mac & Cheese is absolutely divine. The Standard Mac & Cheese was creamy and flavorful, a classic comfort food done right. But the real star was the Lobster Mac & Cheese - a perfect blend of rich, succulent lobster and cheesy goodness. It was an indulgent treat that exceeded all expectations. Paired with a refreshing bottled water, it was a meal to remember. The Mac Shack has certainly raised the bar for all Mac & Cheese eateries. A must-visit for all cheese lovers!|Madrid||2022|9|The Mac Shack
|403|en|4|Disappointment was the main course of my meal at Peking Truck in Madrid. The Combo Lo Mein, far from being a delight, was a bland and uninspiring dish. The noodles were overcooked, lacking the firm texture one expects, and the vegetables were soggy, devoid of any crispness. The promised fusion of flavors was nowhere to be found, replaced instead by a monotonous, salty taste. The presentation was equally lackluster, with everything haphazardly thrown together. For a Chinese menu, I expected more authenticity and flavor. Unfortunately, Peking Truck failed to deliver on both counts.|Madrid||2022|9|Peking Truck
|424|en|4|Disappointment was the main course at The Mac Shack. The Lobster Mac & Cheese, which should have been the star, was bland and lackluster, with barely any discernible lobster. The Buffalo Mac & Cheese was overpoweringly spicy, drowning out any potential flavor. Even the Standard Mac & Cheese, a benchmark for any mac & cheese eatery, was dry and unremarkable. The drinks, Bottled Water, Bottled Soda, and Ice Tea, were the only saving grace, but they can't carry an entire meal. For a place named The Mac Shack, the mac & cheese fails to impress.|Cairo||2022|9|The Mac Shack
|309|en|4|Disappointment was the main course of my meal from Tasty Tibs. The Lean Chicken Tibs lacked the expected Ethiopian spices, resulting in a bland and forgettable dish. The Veggie Combo, while visually appealing, was overcooked, leading to a mushy texture that was far from enjoyable. The bottled soda, the only saving grace, was unfortunately not enough to redeem the overall dining experience. For an Ethiopian cuisine lover, this meal was a miss. I expected more from a truck named Tasty Tibs in a vibrant city like Sao Paulo.|Sao Paulo||2022|9|Tasty Tibs

|193|en|4|Peking Truck's menu selections of Wonton Soup and Combo Lo Mein significantly fell short of expectations. The wonton soup presented a bland flavor profile, lacking the promised savory broth and fresh ingredients. Regretfully, the lo mein was served overcooked, with limp noodles and unremarkable vegetables. The overall food quality was disappointing, and the service was lamentably slow. Despite the convenience of the Warsaw location, it is not worth settling for such mediocre food and poor service.|Warsaw||2022|9|Peking Truck
|413|en|4|The crepes from Le Coin des Crêpes were a mix of satisfying and underwhelming. The Breakfast Crepe, with its blend of eggs, cheese, and ham, was well-prepared and flavorful, offering a delightful start to the day. However, the Chicken Pot Pie Crepe fell short of expectations. The filling was a bit dry, and the crepe itself lacked the crispiness one might anticipate. Despite this, the overall experience was decent, with the unique menu providing a refreshing change from typical fast food options in Barcelona.|Barcelona||2022|9|Le Coin des Crêpes

The Ice Tea and Bottled Water were standard. Overall, it was a satisfactory meal, but the quality of the bread could be improved for a better dining experience."|London||2022|9|Better Off Bread

The Ranch offered a tangy twist, while Miss Piggie, with its bacon infusion, provided a savory delight. Portions were generous, and the service was prompt. However, the cheese in The Original could have been melted more evenly. Overall, a decent experience for grilled cheese enthusiasts."""|Mumbai||2022|9|The Mega Melt

|327|en|4| The Cheeky Greek truck in Rio de Janeiro failed to impress with its Gyros menu. The King Combo and Gyro Plate were disappointing, to say the least. The meat was dry, lacking the juiciness and flavor one would expect from a gyro. The accompanying vegetables were bland, and the pita bread was stale. The portion sizes were also smaller than anticipated. Overall, a disappointing dining experience that did not live up to expectations.|Rio de Janeiro||2022|9|Cheeky Greek
