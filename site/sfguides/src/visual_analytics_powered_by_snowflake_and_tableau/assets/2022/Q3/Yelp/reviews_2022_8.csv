|361|de|4|" ""Freezing Point""-Truck enttäuscht mit Mango Sticky Rice!Ich habe mir in Hamburg das Mango Sticky Rice vom Freezing Point-Truck bestellt und war leider sehr enttäuscht. Der Reis war nicht klebrig genug und die Mango-Sauce schmeckte künstlich und süßlich. Auch die Konsistenz war nicht angenehm, zu flüssig und nicht cremig wie erwartet. Für den Preis hätte ich mir ein viel besseres Ergebnis gewünscht. Schade, denn der Eindruck des Freezing Point-Trucks war ansonsten sehr positiv.(Translation: ""Freezing Point""-Truck disappoints with Mango Sticky Rice!I ordered Mango Sticky Rice from the Freezing Point-Truck in Hamburg and was unfortunately very disappointed. The rice was not sticky enough and the mango sauce tasted artificial and overly sweet. The consistency was also not pleasant, too liquid and not creamy as expected. For the price, I expected much better. It's a shame, because the impression of the Freezing Point-Truck was otherwise very positive.)"|Hamburg||2022|8|Freezing Point

|92|en|4| The Smoky BBQ truck in Vancouver failed to impress with their BBQ offerings. The Rack of Pork Ribs was disappointingly dry and lacked the smoky flavor one would expect from a BBQ joint. The Two Meat Plate and Three Meat Plate were equally underwhelming, with tough, overcooked meat that was difficult to chew. The sides were bland and forgettable, doing little to enhance the overall dining experience. For a BBQ truck, Smoky BBQ missed the mark on delivering flavorful, tender meats. I wouldn't recommend this truck to anyone seeking authentic, delicious BBQ in Vancouver.|Vancouver||2022|8|Smoky BBQ

The crepe itself was dry and overcooked, lacking the delicate texture one would expect. The orange sauce, a crucial element of this dish, was overly sweet and lacked the tangy citrus notes that should have balanced the flavors. The presentation was uninspiring, with no attention to detail. For a restaurant specializing in crepes, this was a subpar experience. I expected more from a London eatery with such a promising name.|London||2022|8|Le Coin des Crêpes

The New York Dog lacked the classic sauerkraut tang, while the Chicago Dog was drowned in an overload of toppings, masking the hot dog itself. The Coney Dog was a bland letdown, missing the expected chili punch. The drinks, Bottled Soda and Ice Tea, were ordinary, offering no redemption to the overall underwhelming experience.

The New York Dog was a classic combination of a soft roll, crisp bacon, tangy sauerkraut, and sweet relish.

|40|en|4|"Disappointment was the main course at ""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"". The Chicago Dog lacked the essential poppy seed bun, and the relish tasted like it came straight from a grocery store jar. The Coney Dog was no better, with a chili that was more reminiscent of canned spaghetti sauce than a hearty, homemade recipe. For a hot dog stand in Seattle, I expected much more. Unfortunately, the name ""Not the Wurst"" might be a bit of an overstatement."|Seattle||2022|8|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs

The generous portion of fluffy curds and crispy fries was adorned with tender beef, a generous scattering of fresh cheese, and a perfectly runny gravy.

The friendly staff and vibrant atmosphere at the truck's location in Madrid made the experience even more enjoyable. Overall, a satisfying and memorable treat for the taste buds."|Madrid||2022|8|Revenge of the Curds
|131|en|4|Disappointment was the main course of my meal at Revenge of the Curds. The Mothers Favorite poutine was far from what a mother would approve, with soggy fries and a lackluster gravy that was more watery than flavorful. The Kitchen Sink, which promised a mix of everything, was just a jumbled mess with no harmony of flavors. The Ice Tea was the only saving grace, but even that was too sweet. The Classic, a staple in any poutine menu, was unfortunately anything but classic. Overall, this London truck failed to deliver the poutine experience I was hoping for.|London||2022|8|Revenge of the Curds
