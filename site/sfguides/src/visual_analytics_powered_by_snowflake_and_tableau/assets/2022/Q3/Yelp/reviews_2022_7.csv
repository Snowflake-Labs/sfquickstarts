|100|en|4|"Disappointment best describes the hot dogs from ""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"". Anticipated chili punch was absent in the Coney Dog, while the Chicago Dog was strangely lacking its trademark pickle tang. The New York Dog merely presented as a lackluster version of the original. Sogginess pervaded the buns, toppings were scarce, leading to an overall underwhelming experience. Given its location in Vancouver, more authenticity and flavor were anticipated from this hot dog stand. Regrettably, ""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"" failed to meet these expectations."|Vancouver||2022|7|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs
