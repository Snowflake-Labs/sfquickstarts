Kiedy mi przynieśli zamówienie, okazało się, że piasek został włożony przypadkowo między placki, co spowodowało zakurzenie i zanieczyszczenie mojego jedzenia. Co gorsza, lodówka nie była na odpowiedniej temperaturze, więc moja herbata lodowa była roztopiona i pijąc ją miałem wrażenie, jakby pił gorącą wodę. Całkowicie zawiedziony jakość mojego zamówienia i nie będę tutaj już nigdy wracać. Porażka.|Warsaw||2022|8|Better Off Bread
