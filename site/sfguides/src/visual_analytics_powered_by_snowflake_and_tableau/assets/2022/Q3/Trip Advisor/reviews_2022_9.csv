Their Lean Chicken Tikka Masala is a delightful blend of rich, aromatic spices and tender chicken, while the Combination Curry offers a medley of flavours that dance on your palate. The Tandoori Mixed Grill is a must-try, with its perfect char and succulent meats. Each dish showcases the authenticity of Indian cuisine, making Nani's Kitchen a go-to spot for anyone craving a taste of India. The quality and flavour are consistently excellent, ensuring a memorable dining experience. Highly recommended!|Melbourne||2022|9|Nani's Kitchen

""Mother's Favorite"" lacked the expected flavor and the cheese curds were not as fresh as promised. ""The Kitchen Sink"" was overloaded with toppings, making it a mess to eat rather than a delight. The bottled water was the only saving grace, but that's not why I visited a food truck. Overall, not a recommendation from my end."|Melbourne||2022|9|Revenge of the Curds

Service sluggish, inefficiency apparent. Naan saving grace, warm and fluffy. Exorbitant price, poor food quality led to a disappointing meal experience. Unlike other Indian restaurants, Nani's Kitchen fails to deliver an authentic and tasty Indian meal.|Stockholm||2022|9|Nani's Kitchen

Beverages, comprised of Bottled Soda, Ice Tea, and Bottled Water, sufficiently met our needs. Nevertheless, food presentation required enhancement. A satisfactory choice for a quick meal in Barcelona.|Barcelona||2022|9|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs

The Chicken Pot Pie Crepe, on the other hand, was an interesting fusion of flavors, though it might not appeal to traditionalists. The bottled soda was a standard accompaniment. Overall, the meal was neither exceptional nor disappointing, making it a decent choice for those seeking variety in their culinary adventures.|Berlin||2022|9|Le Coin des Crêpes
