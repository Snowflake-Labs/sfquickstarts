The hot dogs were juicy and flavorful, and the toppings were fresh and creative. The owner was passionate about his craft and it showed in the quality of the food and the service. I highly recommend checking out this truck if you're ever in Krakow.|Krakow||2022|11|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs
|264|en|3|A delectable experience was had with the Tasty Tibs veggie combo. The injera bread displayed softness and rich flavor. Vegetables were impeccably prepared, retaining their freshness. The berbere spice contributed an invigorating kick without dominating the dish. Service was amicable and expeditious. This restaurant is a must-visit for those seeking authentic Ethiopian cuisine in Seoul.|Seoul||2022|11|Tasty Tibs
|262|en|3|Seitan Buffalo Wings served by Plant Palace proved to be disappointing. The anticipated meaty texture was absent, replaced instead by a mushy and unappetizing consistency. The buffalo sauce, promised to deliver a spicy kick, turned out to be surprisingly bland and uninspiring. Presentation was lackluster, with wings carelessly tossed into the box. In total, the dish failed to provide the desired satisfying vegetarian dining experience within Seoul's diverse culinary landscape.|Seoul||2022|11|Plant Palace
|299|en|3|Nani's Kitchen's food offering proved a regrettable experience. Lean chicken tikka masala arrived dry and lacking in flavor, while the tandoori mixed grill was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture. Moreover, rice was served cold and stuck together, and naan arrived limp and excessively greasy. Attentiveness and efficiency of service were also found wanting. In conclusion, Nani's Kitchen is not a dining establishment I would recommend.|Melbourne||2022|11|Nani's Kitchen
|26|en|3|"This order summary evokes a mouth-watering picture of the perfect comfort food experience. The menu type, ""Poutine,"" alone is a siren song for the stomach, promising crispy curds, gooey cheese, and savory gravy. The truck name, ""Revenge of the Curds,"" adds a playful touch, hinting at the irresistible power of the dish. The item ordered, ""Mothers Favorite,"" further fuels the appetite, while ""The Kitchen Sink"" beverage selection suggests a refreshing accompaniment to the indulgent poutine. All in all, this summary paints a vivid picture of a culinary delight that is sure to satisfy even the most discerning appetite."|Denver||2022|11|Revenge of the Curds
|74|en|3|The food from Nani's Kitchen was as expected for an Indian cuisine truck. The Lean Chicken Tikka Masala was flavorful, with a balanced spice level that didn't overpower the dish. The Tandoori Mixed Grill was well-cooked, offering a nice variety of meats. However, the Combination Curry was a bit underwhelming, lacking the depth of flavor one might anticipate. Overall, it was a satisfactory meal, but it didn't necessarily stand out among other Indian food options in New York City.|New York City||2022|11|Nani's Kitchen
|396|en|3|The Mega Melt truck in Madrid failed to deliver the expected grilled cheese experience. The Ranch sandwich was overwhelmingly drenched in sauce, masking the taste of the cheese and bread. Miss Piggie, supposedly a bacon and cheese delight, was disappointingly short on bacon. The Original, the truck's signature grilled cheese, was underwhelming and lacked the gooey, melty texture one hopes for in a grilled cheese sandwich. The Ice Tea and Bottled Water were the only satisfactory items, but that's not saying much. Overall, a disappointing meal that didn't live up to the hype.|Madrid||2022|11|The Mega Melt

The spring mix salad was fresh and crisp, an ideal complement to the meat. The fried pickles were a perfect side, enhancing the meat-eating experience. Notably, the rack of pork ribs stood out, boasting perfectly caramelized skin and juicy meat. My dining experience at Smoky BBQ was exceptional, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to those seeking a delicious and satisfying meal.|Warsaw||2022|11|Smoky BBQ

|300|en|3| The experience at Better Off Bread was disappointing. The Italian sandwich lacked flavor, the pastrami was dry, and the hot ham and cheese was lukewarm at best. The bottled water and ice tea were the only satisfactory items. For a sandwich truck in Melbourne, I expected more. The menu might say sandwiches, but the execution was far from satisfactory. I wouldn't recommend this truck to anyone looking for a good sandwich experience.|Melbourne||2022|11|Better Off Bread
|389|sv|3|" ""Nani's Kitchen"" i Stockholm är en besvikelse. Beställde Indian food med bland annat Ice Tea, Lean Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Mixed Grill och Combination Curry. Men vad som levererades var en besvikelse. Ice Tea var uttalat vattenig och smaklös, Chicken Tikka Masala var torrt och översalt, Tandoori Mixed Grill var hårt och torrt och Combination Curry var inte i närheten av autentisk indisk smak. Rekommenderar inte att beställa hos Nani's Kitchen i Stockholm."|Stockholm||2022|11|Nani's Kitchen

The bread showed signs of staleness. The friendly staff efficiently addressed the issue. Yet, the subpar food quality and steep prices hinder a recommendation."|Toronto||2022|11|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs

The Greek Salad was a refreshing side, bursting with the tangy taste of feta and crisp, vibrant vegetables. The bottled water was a thoughtful addition, ensuring a well-rounded meal.
