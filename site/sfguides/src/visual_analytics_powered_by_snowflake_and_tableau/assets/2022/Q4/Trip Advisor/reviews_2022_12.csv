The Mango Sticky Rice was an interesting choice, with a unique texture contrast, but the mango flavor could have been more pronounced. The Sugar Cone was crisp and held the ice cream well. The Two Scoop Bowl was a generous portion, perfect for sharing or indulging alone. Overall, a satisfactory experience with room for improvement in some flavors.|Rio de Janeiro||2022|12|Freezing Point
