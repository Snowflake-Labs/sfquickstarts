The crepe was dry and lacked the promised succulent chicken filling and substantial pastry. The crepe Suzette, while visually appealing, tasted disappointingly of store-bought pancake batter and lacked the delicate sweetness and texture associated with a Suzette. The overall experience was unfortunate, resulting in a negative impression of the establishment and its offerings."|Melbourne||2022|11|Le Coin des Crêpes

The Combo Fried Rice lacked flavor and was overly oily, while the Wonton Soup was lukewarm and the wontons themselves were tough and chewy. The menu boasts of Chinese cuisine, but the experience was far from authentic. The truck's name may suggest a journey to the heart of Beijing, but the food served is more akin to a fast food drive-thru. I expected more from a truck named after one of China's culinary capitals. Unfortunately, Peking Truck failed to deliver on both taste and quality.|Cape Town||2022|11|Peking Truck

I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen, expecting a rich and flavorful bowl of noodles, but what I received was a bland and unappetizing mess. The broth lacked depth and richness, and the pork was tough and overcooked. The noodles were also overcooked, leaving them mushy and unappealing. I was truly disappointed with this meal, as I had heard great things about Kitakata's ramen. I would not recommend this dish to anyone looking for an authentic and delicious ramen experience in Mumbai.""
