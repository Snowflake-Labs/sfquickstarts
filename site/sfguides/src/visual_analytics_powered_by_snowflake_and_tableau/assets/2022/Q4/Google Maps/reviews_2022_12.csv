The items ordered are typical Greek cuisine and appear to be standard offerings for a gyros truck. The review section is lacking, as there is no information about the review itself, therefore I cannot provide a neutral review for this order summary."|Mumbai||2022|12|Cheeky Greek

The bread was toasted to a perfect crisp, providing a nice contrast in texture. However, the sandwich could have benefited from a bit more seasoning to fully bring out the flavors. Overall, it's a decent choice for those looking for a hearty grilled cheese option in Melbourne."|Melbourne||2022|12|The Mega Melt
|156|en|2|Disappointment was the main course of my meal at The Mega Melt. The Original grilled cheese, which should have been a simple delight, was surprisingly bland and lackluster. The bread was not toasted to the right crispness, and the cheese failed to deliver that gooey, melty satisfaction one expects. Miss Piggie, advertised as a gourmet grilled cheese with pulled pork, was equally underwhelming. The pork was dry, and the overall flavor profile was unbalanced. To add to the disappointment, the bottled water served was not chilled, a basic expectation that was unfortunately not met. For a grilled cheese truck in Paris, I expected much more.|Paris||2022|12|The Mega Melt
