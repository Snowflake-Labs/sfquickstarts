The explosion of flavors in my mouth is a testament to the authenticity of Indian cuisine that Delhi is famous for. The tenderness of the lean chicken, the smokiness of the mixed grill, and the richness of the combination curry is a gastronomic delight. And of course, the bottled soda is the perfect thirst quencher to complement this delicious meal. Delhiites, don't miss out on this culinary journey! #NanisKitchen #IndianFood #DelhiEats"|Delhi||2022|4|Nani's Kitchen

375237109|350|en|1|The Tonkotsu Ramen at Kitakata Ramen Bar was a disappointment. The broth lacked depth and richness, while the noodles were overcooked and mushy. The Spicy Miso Vegetable Ramen was no better, with a spice level that was barely noticeable and vegetables that were undercooked. The Creamy Chicken Ramen was also a miss, with a cream base that was too heavy and an overall lack of flavor. The Ice Tea and Bottled Water were standard, but did little to improve the overall dining experience in Berlin. Not a recommendation for ramen lovers.|Berlin||2022|4|Kitakata Ramen Bar
375313576|347|en|1| Disappointed with the Smoky BBQ truck in Berlin. The Rack of Pork Ribs was overcooked, resulting in a tough, chewy texture. The Spring Mix Salad was drenched in dressing, overpowering the freshness of the greens. The Bottled Soda was warm, which was a letdown. Overall, the experience did not meet expectations for a BBQ meal.|Berlin||2022|4|Smoky BBQ

The only thing saving this meal was the injera, which was fresh and fluffy. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially if you're looking for authentic Ethiopian food.|Sao Paulo||2022|4|Tasty Tibs

The Fish Burrito was a standout, with its perfectly cooked fish and fresh ingredients wrapped in a warm tortilla. The Lean Burrito Bowl was a healthier option that didn't compromise on taste. The bottled water and ice tea were refreshing accompaniments. This food truck is a must-visit in Delhi for anyone craving authentic and delicious Mexican cuisine. The service was prompt and friendly. Guac n' Roll, you've won my heart and tummy!|Delhi||2022|4|Guac n' Roll
93875620|250|en|1|"""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"" truck's culinary selections fell regrettably short of anticipations. Bottled soda served tepid, and hot dogs fell short of being juicy, flavorful creations advertised. The New York Dog, with sparse toppings, lacked the crunch and tang promised. The Chicago Dog, burdened with an avalanche of toppings, suffered from over-sweetening and mushy bread. The Coney Dog, a symbol of simplicity, was tainted by a cheap, withered hot dog and a feeble sprinkling of cheese. Altogether, a profoundly disappointing experience."|Tokyo||2022|4|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs
