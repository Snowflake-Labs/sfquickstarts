However, the sandwiches were lackluster, with dry, flavorless meat and stale bread. The Ice Tea was also a letdown, tasting watered down and lacking any sweetness or refreshment. I expected better from a place calling themselves 'Better Off Bread.' Save your money and look elsewhere for a decent lunch."""|Sydney||2022|4|Better Off Bread

The chicken pot pie filling was packed with flavor and an ideal balance of vegetables and chicken. However, the combination of the two elements didn't quite meet expectations. The rich filling of the pot pie appeared to overpower the subtle flavor of the crepe.
