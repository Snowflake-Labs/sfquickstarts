The fried pickles were a disappointment, with little to no seasoning or flavor. The rack of pork ribs was overcooked, causing the meat to fall off the bone with ease.

The Ice Tea was refreshing, a perfect blend of sweet and tangy, providing a delightful break from the bustling city of Mumbai. The star of the show, however, was the Tandoori Mixed Grill.
