The Combo Lo Mein was a bland, uninspiring take on a classic dish, lacking the vibrant flavors one would expect from Chinese cuisine. The Wonton Soup, while adequately warm, was nothing more than a forgettable sidekick to an already underwhelming meal. To top it off, the Ice Tea was watered down, failing to provide a refreshing balance to the meal.

The Buffalo Mac & Cheese was smothered in an excessively spicy sauce, overwhelming the dish. Most disappointing was the Lobster Mac & Cheese, anticipated to be the highlight, but it was a disappointment with scarcely any lobster present.

|184|en|2|"Mac Shack's mac and cheese offerings were a letdown. The Standard Mac & Cheese lacked flavor and any semblance of cheesiness. The Buffalo Mac & Cheese provided a slight spicy kick, but the cheese remained disappointingly lacking in creaminess and richness. The Lobster Mac & Cheese, despite its promise of ""lobster tails in a dream,"" proved to be a misnomer. The lobster flavor was faint and the lobster itself was scarce. At least the bottled water was chilled and refreshing, providing a brief respite from the unremarkable mac and cheese. In conclusion, The Mac Shack is not a recommended destination for those seeking a fulfilling mac and cheese experience."|Warsaw||2022|5|The Mac Shack

|403|en|2| The Peking Truck in Madrid is a culinary gem! The Combo Fried Rice was a delightful blend of flavors, while the Wonton Soup was comforting and heartwarming. The Combo Lo Mein was the star of the show, with its perfect balance of textures and tastes. The bottled water was a refreshing complement to the meal. The Chinese menu offered a variety of options, making it a great choice for those seeking authentic Chinese cuisine. The truck's service was efficient and friendly. Overall, a fantastic dining experience that I highly recommend!|Madrid||2022|5|Peking Truck
|401|en|2|"""Revenge of the Curds"" truck in Madrid fails to deliver on authentic poutine. ""Mother's Favorite"" falls short with unremarkable gravy and limp fries. ""The Kitchen Sink"" presents a disorganized mix of ingredients, lacking harmony and balance. Even ""The Classic"" misses the mark, skimping on essential cheese curds that define poutine. Diluted Ice Tea further adds to the overall disappointing experience. This food truck should urgently reconsider its recipes and quality control."|Madrid||2022|5|Revenge of the Curds

Generously melted cheese oozed, perfectly complementing the succulent pork. The sweet and savory flavors harmoniously danced on the palate, leaving a satisfying impression. The experience was further enhanced by the generous portions and friendly service.|Madrid||2022|5|The Mega Melt
