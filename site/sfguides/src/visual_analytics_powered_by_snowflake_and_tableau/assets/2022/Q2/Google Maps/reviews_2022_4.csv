The broth was thin and lacked the savory punch I'd expect from a miso-based broth. The vegetables were limp and uninspired. The bottled water was the only redeeming quality of this meal. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."|Berlin||2022|4|Kitakata Ramen Bar

The service was prompt and friendly. Overall, it was a decent dining experience, but there's certainly room for improvement in terms of flavor balance.|Berlin||2022|4|Cheeky Greek

|434|en|2|Disappointment was the main course at Nani's Kitchen. The Combination Curry lacked depth, tasting more like a watered-down version of its potential. The Tandoori Mixed Grill, while visually appealing, was dry and lacked the smoky flavor one expects. The Lean Chicken Tikka Masala, a staple of Indian cuisine, was surprisingly bland and unremarkable. The bottled soda and water were standard, but did little to elevate the meal. For an Indian food experience in Cairo, I expected more authenticity and flavor. Nani's Kitchen, unfortunately, fell short.|Cairo||2022|4|Nani's Kitchen

The 'Mother's Favorite' was a standout dish, boasting rich gravy and perfectly melted cheese curds over crispy fries. However, 'The Kitchen Sink' failed to meet expectations, as the toppings overpowered the essential poutine elements, making it less enjoyable. A refreshing accompaniment, the bottled soda provided a necessary balance to the heavier dishes. Ultimately, the experience was average, with some hits and misses on the menu.|Munich||2022|4|Revenge of the Curds
