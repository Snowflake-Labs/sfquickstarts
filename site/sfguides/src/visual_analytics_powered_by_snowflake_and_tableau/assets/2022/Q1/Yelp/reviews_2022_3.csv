|113|fr|4| «Le Coin des Crêpes à Montréal, je suis déçu de ma récente expérience. J'ai commandé une crêpe pour le déjeuner et une autre au poulet à la crème, et malheureusement, les deux étaient loin d'être satisfaisantes. La crêpe du déjeuner était sèche et élastique, manquant de saveur et de fraîcheur. La crème au poulet, quant à elle, était trop grasse et manquait de définition de goût. Je m'attendais à de délicieuses crêpes savoureuses et fraîches, mais je n'ai pas du tout été convaincu. Je ne recommanderais pas Le Coin des Crêpes à Montréal et je ne compte pas y retourner.»|Montreal||2022|3|Le Coin des Crêpes
