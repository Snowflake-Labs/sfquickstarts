|372|en|4|Disappointment was the main course with my order from Cheeky Greek in Hamburg. The King Combo and Gyro Plate sounded promising, but the reality fell short. The gyro meat was dry, lacking the juicy tenderness I expected. The accompanying vegetables were uninspiring, and the sauce was bland, failing to add any excitement to the dish. The portion size was also smaller than anticipated. Overall, the meal was a letdown and not worth the price. I had hoped for a taste of Greece, but instead, I got a forgettable dining experience.|Hamburg||2022|2|Cheeky Greek
|231|en|4|"""The Mega Melt truck in Delhi is a must-visit for grilled cheese lovers! I recently tried The Original, The Ranch, and Miss Piggie, and each one was more delicious than the last. The Original was a classic, gooey delight, while The Ranch added a tangy twist that I couldn't get enough of. But the real star was Miss Piggie – the combination of crispy bacon and melted cheese was absolute perfection. The staff was friendly and efficient, making for a great overall experience. I'll definitely be back for more!"""|Delhi||2022|2|The Mega Melt

The curry presented a medley of flavors, with each ingredient contributing its unique taste. The chicken tikka masala, on the other hand, was tender and lean, living up to its description. However, the accompanying ice tea was a tad too sweet for my preference. Overall, the meal was satisfying, but there's room for improvement in the beverage department.|Delhi||2022|2|Nani's Kitchen

The buffalo sauce was flavorful, with a subtle kick that complemented the seitan well. The Salad of All Salads, on the other hand, was a mixed bag. While the variety of greens and vegetables was impressive, the dressing could have benefited from a more balanced flavor profile. The bottled water served its purpose adequately. Overall, the Plant Palace in New York City provides a commendable dining experience for those seeking vegetarian options.|New York City||2022|2|Plant Palace

The Buffalo Mac & Cheese lacked the promised kick, while the Lobster Mac & Cheese was overwhelmingly creamy, drowning out the lobster's delicate flavor.

While the overall flavor and presentation were commendable, there's room for enhancement in terms of value for money.|Seoul||2022|2|The Mac Shack
|79|es|4|" ""The Mac Shack"" em Toronto ofrece una experiencia deplorable con su menú de mac y queso. Ordené una botella de agua y tres tipos diferentes de mac y queso: estándar, langosta y búfalo. Desafortunadamente, la langosta en el mac y queso de langosta era escasa y sin sabor, y el búfalo carecía de la suficiente salsa picante para darle un verdadero sabor a búfalo. El mac y queso estándar era el único que se acercaba a ser aceptable, pero aun así, no valía la pena el alto precio que se paga. En general, mi experiencia con ""The Mac Shack"" fue decepcionante y no recomendaría este lugar a nadie en busca de una buena comida de mac y queso en Toronto."|Toronto||2022|2|The Mac Shack

The cheese was barely melted, and the overall taste was bland, missing the rich, gooey goodness that defines a great grilled cheese. The presentation was also underwhelming. For a place that prides itself on grilled cheese, The Mega Melt failed to deliver on both taste and quality. Not recommended for cheese lovers in Delhi."|Delhi||2022|2|The Mega Melt
|257|en|4|The food at Smoky BBQ was a disappointment. The spring mix salad was wilted and unappetizing, and the rack of pork ribs was dry and overcooked. The service was also poor, with long wait times and a staff that was not attentive. Overall, I would not recommend Smoky BBQ to anyone.|Seoul||2022|2|Smoky BBQ
|392|es|4| ¡Qué decepción con la orden de Smoky BBQ en Madrid! Después de esperar con tantas ganas un plato de barbacoa, nos decepcionó encontrarnos con carne seca y sin sabor en nuestras bandejas de dos y tres carnes. Incluso los aperitivos, como las rodajas de pepinillos fritos, estaban desabridos y sin chispa. Además, el agua y la gaseosa en botella resultaron ser una elección costosa y poco práctica en comparación con otras opciones de bebidas. En definitiva, nuestra experiencia con Smoky BBQ en Madrid fue decepcionante y no recomendamos este lugar a los amantes de la barbacoa.|Madrid||2022|2|Smoky BBQ
