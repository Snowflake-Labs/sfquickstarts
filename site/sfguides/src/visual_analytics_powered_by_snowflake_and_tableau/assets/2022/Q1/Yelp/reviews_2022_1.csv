The hot dog was overcooked, resulting in a dry, tough texture. The toppings were lackluster, with sauerkraut that lacked tanginess and mustard that was barely noticeable. The bun was the only saving grace, but it couldn't compensate for the overall underwhelming experience. This hot dog didn't live up to its name, and unfortunately, it wasn't even close to being the best."|Tokyo||2022|1|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs
