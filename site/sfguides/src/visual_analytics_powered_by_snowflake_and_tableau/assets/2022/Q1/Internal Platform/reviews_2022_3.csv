The Kitchen Sink, with its perfect blend of ingredients, offered a unique twist to the traditional poutine, while The Classic was a delightful reminder of why this dish is a Canadian favorite. The fries were crispy, the cheese curds were fresh and squeaky, and the gravy was rich and savory. Paired with a refreshing bottled water, it was the perfect meal. Revenge of the Curds is a must-visit for poutine lovers!"""|Montreal||2022|3|Revenge of the Curds

The broth presented a luscious and creamy texture, complemented by a restrained yet appealing umami taste that neither dominated nor receded. The noodles exhibited a commendable cooking consistency, boasting a firm yet tender bite. The pork yielded tenderly to the bite, packed with rich taste. However, the egg, though satisfactory in size, could have been infused with more seasoning and cooked to a softer texture. The serving size was ample, culminating in a satisfying meal experience. Despite its merits, the bowl of ramen stands poised for further enhancement in particular areas.|Boston||2022|3|Kitakata Ramen Bar
