The wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was tangy and creamy, and the portion size was generous. Overall, I would highly recommend this dish to anyone looking for a vegetarian option that is both flavorful and satisfying.|Seoul||2022|1|Plant Palace

A carne magra e saborosa, marinada em especiarias e cozida ao ponto, combinada com a salsa cremosa e aromática, é uma verdadeira delícia para os sentidos. Recomendo vivamente a Nani's Kitchen para quem deseja experimentar a autêntica culinária indiana em São Paulo. Obrigado por fornecer uma experiência gastronômica tão maravilhosa!|Sao Paulo||2022|1|Nani's Kitchen
