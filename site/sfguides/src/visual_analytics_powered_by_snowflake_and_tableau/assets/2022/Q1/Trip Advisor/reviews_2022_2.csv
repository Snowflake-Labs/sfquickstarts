The curds were far from the desired crispy, golden standard, instead, they were limp and rubbery. Accompanying this was a gravy that fell short of expectations, being bland and watery, devoid of the anticipated rich, beefy flavor. The fries, unfortunately, were soggy and undercooked, while the cheese was scarcely distributed and poorly melted. In summary, this poutine fell significantly short of culinary expectations, making it hard to recommend."|Montreal||2022|2|Revenge of the Curds

Cheese stood out as a redeeming factor with its generosity and ideal melting. Sandwich's quality did not justify its cost. Texture of the bread was overly crumbly, and sharpness of cheese contrasted harshly with the bland meat. I cannot endorse this sandwich.|Warsaw||2022|2|Better Off Bread
