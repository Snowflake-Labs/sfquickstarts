```
### Is there precipitation or snowfall in NY zipcodes
``` sql
create or replace view vhol_weather_vw as
  select 'New York'                                   state,
    date_valid_std                                    observation_date,
    doy_std                                           day_of_year,
    avg(min_temperature_air_2m_f)                     temp_min_f,

    truncate(avg(tot_snowfall_in * 25.4), 1)          tot_snowfall_mm,
    truncate(avg(tot_snowdepth_in * 25.4), 1)         tot_snowdepth_mm
  from weather.standard_tile.history_day
  where postal_code in ('10257', '10060', '10128', '07307', '10456')
  group by 1, 2, 3;
  
select * from vhol_weather_vw limit 10;
```
<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Enrich with Geospatial Station Data 
We just have station_id, so let's get geospatial data to locate those stations on map

###  Access data from AWS API Gateway
``` sql  
-- Integration to AWS API Gateway 
create or replace api integration fetch_http_data
  api_provider = aws_api_gateway
  api_aws_role_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::148887191972:role/ExecuteLambdaFunction'
  enabled = true
  api_allowed_prefixes = ('https://dr14z5kz5d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/fetchhttpdata');
```

``` sql 
-- External Function call to Lambda to download data 

create or replace external function fetch_http_data(v varchar)
    returns variant
    api_integration = fetch_http_data
    as 'https://dr14z5kz5d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/fetchhttpdata';
```
###

### Flatten JSON data received from API's

Geospatial data is available in a nested json array, let's flatten that 

``` sql 
-- use lateral flatten function to flatten nested JSON
create or replace table vhol_spatial_data as
with gbfs as (
  select $1 type, 
     fetch_http_data($2) payload
  from (values
    ('region', 'https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/system_regions.json'),
    ('station', 'https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json'),
    ('neighborhood', 'https://snowflake-demo-stuff.s3.amazonaws.com/neighborhoods.geojson'))
  )
  select type, value v
    from gbfs, lateral flatten (input => payload:response.data.regions)
    where type = 'region'
  union all
  select type, value v
    from gbfs, lateral flatten (input => payload:response.data.stations)
    where type = 'station'
  union all
  select type, value v
    from gbfs, lateral flatten (input => payload:response.features)
    where type = 'neighborhood';
    
    
    select * from vhol_spatial_data;
  ```

###

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Correlate Trips, Weather and Geospatial Data

### Combine station data with geospatial data
``` sql 
create or replace table vhol_stations as with 
  -- Extract the station data
    s as (select 
        v:station_id::number station_id,
        v:region_id::number region_id,
        v:name::string station_name,
        v:lat::float station_lat,
        v:lon::float station_lon,
        st_point(station_lon, station_lat) station_geo,
        v:station_type::string station_type,
        v:capacity::number station_capacity,
        v:rental_methods rental_methods
    from vhol_spatial_data
    where type = 'station'),
    -- Extract the region data
    r as (select
        v:region_id::number region_id,
        v:name::string region_name
    from vhol_spatial_data
    where type = 'region'),
    -- Extract the neighborhood data
    n as (select
        v:properties.neighborhood::string nhood_name,
        v:properties.borough::string borough_name,
        to_geography(v:geometry) nhood_geo
    from vhol_spatial_data
    where type = 'neighborhood')   
-- Join it all together using a spatial join
select station_id, station_name, station_lat, station_lon, station_geo,
  station_type, station_capacity, rental_methods, region_name,
  nhood_name, borough_name, nhood_geo
from s inner join r on s.region_id = r.region_id
       left outer join n on st_contains(n.nhood_geo, s.station_geo);

-- Query station data 
select * from vhol_stations;
``` 

### Combine Trips, Geospatial and Stations 

Let's combine trip data with geospatial to identify popular routes
```sql
create or replace view vhol_trips_stations_vw as (
  with
    t as (select * from vhol_trips_vw),
    ss as (select * from vhol_stations),
    es as (select * from vhol_stations)
  select 
    t.tripid, 
    starttime, endtime, duration, start_station_id,
    ss.station_name start_station, ss.region_name start_region,
    ss.borough_name start_borough, ss.nhood_name start_nhood, 
    ss.station_geo start_geo, ss.station_lat start_lat, ss.station_lon start_lon,
    ss.nhood_geo start_nhood_geo, 
    end_station_id, es.station_name end_station, 
    es.region_name end_region, es.borough_name end_borough, 
    es.nhood_name end_nhood, es.station_geo end_geo, 
    es.station_lat end_lat, es.station_lon end_lon,
    es.nhood_geo end_nhood_geo,
    bikeid, bike_type, dob, gender, member_type, payment, payment_type, payment_num
  from t 
    left outer join ss on start_station_id = ss.station_id
    left outer join es on end_station_id = es.station_id); 
```

###  

### Combine Trip, Geospatial, Stations and Weather data
```sql 
create or replace view vhol_trips_stations_weather_vw as (
  select t.*, temp_avg_c, temp_avg_f,
         wind_dir, wind_speed_mph, wind_speed_kph
  from vhol_trips_stations_vw t 
       left outer join vhol_weather_vw w on date_trunc('day', starttime) = observation_date);


-- Let's query the integrated data view
select * from vhol_trips_stations_vw limit 200;
select * from vhol_trips_stations_weather_vw limit 200;
```

## Login to Tableau Online & Connect to Snowflake

Navigate to https://online.tableau.com/ and login to Tableau Cloud (Online) using your login credentials.

![A](assets/Tab_1.1.png)

<br>

You will be redirected to the Tableau Cloud (Online) Home page. Within the blue “Welcome to your Tableau site” banner, click into the “New” dropdown and select “Workbook”.

![A](assets/Tab_1.2.png)

<br>

You will be automatically prompted to connect to a data source. Within the “Connect to Data” popup window, select “Connectors”. Find *Snowflake* in the grid. 
Note: you may need to use the horizontal bottom scrollbar at the bottom of the window and scroll to the right of the “Connections" tab.

![A](assets/Tab_1.3.png)

<br>

Enter the Server name. Change Authentication to “Username and Password”, enter your login credentials, then click the blue “Sign in” button.

![A](assets/Tab_1.4.png)

<br>

Within the connections pane, make the following selections:

* Warehouse: VHOL_WH
* Database: VHOL_DATABASE
* Schema: VHOL_Schema


A list of tables will appear:

![A](assets/Tab_1.5.png)

<br>

Hover over the border of the Connections pane window until a black icon appears, then drag the “Connections” window to the right to make it wider. Widen the pane until you can read the full table names. Scroll down in the list of available tables until you find a table called “VHOL_Trips_Stations_Weather_VW”. 

![A](assets/Tab_1.6.png)

<br>

Drag that table out onto the main section of the screen, where it says “Drag tables here”.

![A](assets/Tab_1.7.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Configure Data Source Filters

By adding data source filters, we can exclude any outliers that may hinder performance or skew our data. We are going to be adding 3 data source filters total. 

In the top right corner of the screen, locate where it says “Filters”. Under “Filters”, there is a button that says “Add”. Click the “Add” button.

![A](assets/Tab_2.1.png)

<br>

On the bottom left of the pop-up “Edit Data Source Filters” window, click “Add Filter”. 

![A](assets/Tab_2.2.png)

<br>

Within the pop-up, start typing “Start Station”. Click the “Start Station” field. 

![A](assets/Tab_2.3.png)

<br>

When the list of Station Names appear, click “Null”, then click “Exclude selected values”. After that, click the blue “OK” button in the bottom right of the pop-up.

![A](assets/Tab_2.4.png)

<br>

Repeat these steps for “End Station”; Add Filter → search “End Station” → click Null → Exclude selected values → OK. 
![A](assets/Tab_2.5.png)

<br>

Lastly, repeat the same steps steps for “Start Borough”; Add Filter → search “Start Borough” → click Null → Exclude selected values → OK.

![A](assets/Tab_2.6.png)

<br>

All 3 Data Source filters should appear within the “Edit Data Source Filters” window, and the “Details” column of the table confirms we are excluding Nulls. Once you’ve confirmed the data source filters have been set correctly, click the blue “OK” button in the bottom right of the “Edit Data Source Filters” window.

![A](assets/Tab_2.7.png)

<br>

We have successfully filtered out incomplete trips or trips without a documented start borough.

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Visualize Spatial Data

Now we are ready to visualize our data! In the bottom left of the screen, click “Sheet 1”.

![A](assets/Tab_3.1.png)

<br>

Let’s start by creating a simple calculation to count the number of trips in our data set. In the upper toolbar (the toolbar that contains “File”, locate the “Analysis” tab. Within the “Analysis” dropdown, click “Create Calculated Field...”

![A](assets/Tab_3.2.png)

<br>

Change the name of the calculation from “Calculation1” to “Trip Journey”. Click into the blank calculation window below; once a flashing cursor appears, type:

```
MAKELINE([Start Geo],[End Geo])
```

This calculation is creating a line between the station a rider began the ride, and the station a rider ended their ride, effectively plotting the journey they made. 

Locate the new “Trip Journey” field within the left Data pane. Immediately after you close the calculated field window, Trip Journey will be highlighted in blue. When a field is blue in Tableau, it means it is a dimension or, in this case, a categorical geographic field.

![A](assets/Tab_3.3.png)

<br>

Click and drag the Trip Journey field into the workspace, where it says “drop field here”. Tableau is going to spin for a moment here, but it shouldn’t take more than 45-60 seconds. Not only is this complex spatial data, but it’s the first time Tableau is indexing it or storing it in its cache — this initial ingestion step is the only time it will take this long to render.

Upon rendering, you’ll notice that Tableau not only automatically creates a map for us, but also plots a line between the start location and the end location.

![A](assets/Tab_3.4.png)

<br>

If you hover over the map, you will notice that Tableau is grouping all of the trips together into one single Mark. By adding layers of detail, we can isolate each individual trip. 

The first Detail we will add is “Start Station”. Locate the “Start Station” field in the Data pane, and drag it onto the “Detail” icon within the Marks card. Tableau will spin for a bit, but it shouldn’t take more than 30-45 seconds to render.

![A](assets/Tab_3.5.png)

<br>

Repeat the steps above with “End Station”. Locate the “End Station” field within the Data pane, then drag it onto Detail. Tableau will spin for a bit, but it shouldn’t take more than 30-45 seconds to render.

![A](assets/Tab_3.6.png)

<br>

Now hover over any of the marks on the map. You will see we’ve effectively isolated the different trips, creating a mark for each journey.

![A](assets/Tab_3.7.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Add KPIs to the Tooltip

The white box that appears when you hover over a mark on a view within a Tableau worksheet or Tableau dashboard is called a “Tooltip”. As you build in Tableau, you have the flexibility and autonomy to customize Tooltips as you see fit. 

Currently, our Tooltip only contains **Start Station** and **End Station**, and it isn’t formatted super intuitively. Let’s add a few other interesting metrics, then adjust the formatting to read more like a sentence.

We'll begin by writing another calculation. Within the “Analysis” dropdown, click “Create Calculated Field...”

![A](assets/Tab_4.1.png)

<br>

Rename the field from “Calculation 1” to “Number of Trips”. Click into the blank calculation window below; once a flashing cursor appears, type:
```
CountD([Tripid])
```

Click the blue “OK” button on the bottom right of the calculated field window.  

Locate the new “Number of Trips” field within the left Data pane. When you close the calculated field window, the “Number of Trips” field will be highlighted in green. 

Click and drag “Number of Trips” onto the “Tooltip” icon within the Marks card.

![A](assets/Tab_4.2.png)

<br>

Next, locate the “Duration” field. As you did with “Number of Trips”, drag and drop “Duration” onto the “Tooltip” icon within the Marks card.

When Duration is dropped on Tooltip,  you’ll notice Tableau sets the aggregation to SUM(). In our case, we actually do not want to find the sum, we want to find the average. Fortunately, Tableau makes it easy to alter the aggregation type. Simply hover over the green SUM(Duration) field within the Marks card until an arrow appears in the right corner of the field. Click that arrow to open a drop-down menu and change “Measure” from **Sum** to **Average**.

![A](assets/Tab_4.3.png)

<br>

Now hover over any of the lines on the map. You’ll notice the Tooltip now contains the number of trips taken and the average duration of each trip in minutes.

![A](assets/Tab_4.4.png)

<br>

As I mentioned, Tooltips can easily be reformatted. Click the Tooltip icon within the Marks card to open a rich text editor.

![A](assets/Tab_4.5.png)

<br>

Within the “Edit Tooltip” window, highlight all of the auto-populated text and delete it. (Don’t worry, it isn’t gone forever, we’re just going to present the information differently).

In the blank window, type or paste:
```
“*<AGG(Number of Trips)>* people rode a CitiBike from *<Start Station>* to *<End Station>*.
On average, this trip took *<AVG(Duration)> minutes* to complete.”
```

Make sure to bold all of the field names before hitting the blue “OK” button at the bottom of the window.

![A](assets/Tab_4.6.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Add Map Layers

Now, we can add Map Layers. 

Locate the “Start Geo” field in the Data pane, and drag it into the view, directly on top of our existing map. You’ll notice a “Map Layers” icon appears in the top left corner of the Map. Drag the “Start Geo” field onto that button, making sure to release the field only when the Map Layers icon is highlighted in orange. 

![A](assets/Tab_5.1.png)

<br>

Repeat this process with the “End Geo” field.

![A](assets/Tab_5.2.png)

<br>

Let’s pause and assess our map. We now have a line representing the journey each rider took, a dot where they started, and a dot where they ended. 

You’ll notice that within the Marks card, Tableau has isolated all three of our Map layers: Start Geo, End Geo, and Trip Journey.

![A](assets/Tab_5.3.png)

<br>

We can reorder these layers via simple drag and drop.  Let’s move ”Start Geo“ above ”End Geo“. Click the ”Start Geo“ tab and drag it above the ”End Geo“ tab.

![A](assets/Tab_5.4.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Format Map Layers

Select the “Start Geo” section of the Marks card, then click the “Color” button within the “Start Geo” Marks card.

![A](assets/Tab_6.1.png)

<br>

At the top of the “Color” pop-up menu, click the lightest shade of *blue*. At the bottom of the “Color” pop-up, click into the “Halo” drop-down. Within this menu, select the darkest shade of *blue*. The marks on the map update immediately.

<br>

Next, let’s customize the “End Geo” map layer to differentiate the starting point from the ending point. 

Select the “End Geo” section of the Marks card, then click the “Color” icon. At the top of the “Color” pop-up menu, click the lightest shades of *orange*. At the bottom of the “Color” pop-up, click into the “Halo” drop-down. Within this menu, select the darkest shade of *orange*. Again, the marks on the map update immediately.

![A](assets/Tab_6.3.png)

<br>

The last Map Layer to customize is “Trip Journey”. Select the “Trip Journey” section of the Marks card, then click the “Color” icon. At the top of the “Color” pop-up, click the second to lightest shade of gray.

![A](assets/Tab_6.4.png)

<br>

Now, click the “Size” icon directly to the right of the “Color” icon. Drag the Size slider to the left, decreasing the Mark Size by approximately 50%.

![A](assets/Tab_6.5.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Enhance the Map with Custom Backgrounds

Within the top toolbar directly to the right of “Analysis”, click into the “Map” tab. 

Hover over the first option in the pop-up drop-down, “Background Maps”, and change the selection from “Light” to “Normal”. You’ll notice we now have color and shading to help us differentiate streets from water and landmarks.

![A](assets/Tab_7.1.png)

<br>

Go back to the “Map” tab in the top toolbar. This time, click into “Background Layers...”. Tableau comes packaged with a wide variety of background map details for you to enable or disable as you choose. In our case, let’s add “Streets, Highways, Routes” to our view. Simply click that checkbox within the list.

![A](assets/Tab_7.2.png)

<br>

Exit the “Background Layers” pane by clicking the “X” on the top right. Clicking this X will bring you back to the familiar Data pane.

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Format Worksheet Title & Add Filter

Now, let’s format the title of this worksheet! Much like you can do with Tooltips, you have the ability to customize and integrate key fields or metrics in your title as well.

There are two fields I would like to add to our title that isn’t currently in our view: start time and average temperature. 

To incorporate these fields into the view, start by clicking into the “Start Geo” tab within the Marks card.

![A](assets/Tab_8.1.png)

<br>

Locate the “Starttime” field within the Data pane, then drag that field onto the “Detail” icon within the Marks card.

![A](assets/Tab_8.2.png)

<br>

You’ll notice that Tableau automatically groups the dates by year. While rolling up to a yearly level may be helpful in some cases, it isn’t what we want here. 

To alter this, hover over the blue YEAR(Starttime) field within the Marks card until an arrow appears in the right corner of the field. Click that arrow to open a drop-down menu.

Within the menu, select the *second* “Month” option from the lower section of the drop-down.

![A](assets/Tab_8.3.png)

<br>

Next, locate the “Temp Avg F” field within the Data pane, then drag that field onto the “Detail” icon within the Marks card.

Just like “Duration“, Tableau set the aggregation to sum. To change it to average, simply hover over the green SUM(Temp Avg F) field within the Marks card until an arrow appears in the right corner of the field. Click that arrow to open a drop-down menu and change “Measure” from Sum to Average.

![A](assets/Tab_8.4.png)

<br>

Now, double click where it says “Sheet 1” above the map. This will open a rich text editor.

Delete “Sheet 1” and type or paste:
```
CitiBike Bike Rides in <MONTH(Starttime)> (Avg Temp: <AVG(Temp Avg F)> °F) <br>
The dark gray lines represent *trip* *journeys*, the blue dots represent the *Start Station*, and the orange dots represent the *End Station*. Hover over any line to see the number of trips taken and the average trip time in minutes.
```

Highlight “CitiBike Bike Rides in <MONTH(Starttime)> (Avg Temp: <AVG(Temp Avg F)> °F)” and change the font size to *20*.

Highlight “The dark gray lines represent *trip* *journeys*, the blue dots represent the *Start Station*, and the orange dots represent the *End Station*. Hover over any line to see the number of trips taken and the average trip time in minutes.“ and change the font size to *12*.

![A](assets/Tab_8.5.png)

<br>

Finally, let’s add a filter into our view. 

Locate the “Start Borough” field within the Data pane, then drag that field onto the Filters card. 

![A](assets/Tab_8.6.png)

<br>

In the pop-up “Filter [Start Borough]” menu, select (All) then hit the blue “OK” button.

![A](assets/Tab_8.7.png)

<br>

On the bottom left of the screen, right click where it says “Sheet 1” and select “Rename” from the menu. Update the Sheet name to “Map”.

![A](assets/Tab_8.8.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Create and Publish a Simple Dashboard
Click the middle icon on the bottom banner.

The first thing we are going to do adjust our dashboard size. On the far left of the screen, you’ll notice that the *Data* pane has been replaced with the *Dashboard* pane — that’s how you can confirm you are authoring a dashboard, not a worksheet.

To change the size of the dashboard, find the “Size” section within the Dashboard pane and click where it says “Desktop Browser (1000 x 800)”. 

Alter the dashboard sizing accordingly: 

* Width *1150*
* Height *700*


Locate the “Maps” worksheet under the “Sheets” section of the Dashboard pane. Click and drag that worksheet into the workspace, releasing where it says “Add sheets here”. If we had made more than one worksheet, you would repeat this process until all of the desired sheets were added to your dashboard.

![A](assets/Tab_9.1.png)

<br>

We’re done! Right click on “Dashboard 1” and rename it “CitiBike”. Click the blue “Publish” button at the top of the screen. Name the Workbook “CitiBike” and, under Location, select your “default” folder. When you’re done, hit the blue “Publish” button at the bottom of the screen to.

![A](assets/Tab_9.2.png)

<br>

After it finishes processing your request, the dashboard will load and a pop-up message will appear at the top of the screen. Within that message, click “Go to workbook”.

![A](assets/Tab_9.3.png)

<br>

Select “CitiBike” to load the dashboard.

![A](assets/Tab_9.4.png)

<br>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<!-- ------------------------ -->

<br>

## Embed the Dashboard into a Web Page
Click the white “Share” button at the top right of the screen. 

![A](assets/Tab_10.1.png)

<br>

Under “Share using a link”, click “Copy Link”.

![A](assets/Tab_10.2.png)

<br>

As a prerequisite, you were instructed to download a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Open that Application.

![A](assets/Tab_10.3.png)

<br>

Locate the  “Tableau Embedded Portal” folder we provided at the begging on this lab. 

![A](assets/Tab_10.4.png)

<br>

Open the “Tableau Embedded Portal” folder in VS Code by clicking “Open” on the “Get Started” window and then selecting the folder name, or by simply dragging the folder into the VS Code window.

![A](assets/Tab_10.5.png)

<br>

Once you’ve opened the folder in VS Code, you’ll notice two key files: dashboard.html and embed.js. Within the lefthand “Explorer” pane, click to open the *embed.js* file. 

![A](assets/Tab_10.6.png)

<br>

On line 8 where the annotations prompt you to “PASTE LINK HERE“, paste the embed link we copied from Tableau Online. After pasting, save your changes using File → Save.

![A](assets/Tab_10.7.png)

<br>

Now within the “Explorer” pane, right click on “dashboard.html” and select “Open in Default Browser” from the drop-down menu. This will open the webpage you just embedded your Tableau dashboard into.

![A](assets/Tab_10.8.png)

<br>

Now we can not only view our Tableau dashboard within an external webpage, but we can actually interact with it!

![A](assets/Tab_10.9.png)

<br>

Remember when we added the “Start Borough” field into our worksheet in Tableau Online? By doing that, we told Tableau we want to use that field as a filter. This enables us to leverage Tableau’s JavaScript API to translate the selections we make within a webpage into filters within Tableau.

In the left pane of the webpage, click “Start Borough”. Select “Brooklyn” within the “Start Boroughs” filter menu. That selection will be passed into Tableau.

![A](assets/Tab_10.10.png)

<br>

The dashboard will zoom and filter, showing us only trips that started in Brooklyn.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! you have completed the lab.

In this lab we captured semi-structured data coming from NewYork Citibikes, enriched that data with geospatial data, and weather data from  Snowflake Data marketplace data to find correlation between demand for bicycles and weather. We visualized the data using Tableau to quickly arrive at relevant insights.
