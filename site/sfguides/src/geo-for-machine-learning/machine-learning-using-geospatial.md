# Geospatial Analytics, AI and ML using Snowflake
<!-- ----------------------------------------- -->
## Overview 

Duration: 6

Snowflake offers a rich toolkit for predictive analytics with a geospatial component. It includes two data types and specialized functions for transformation, prediction, and visualization. This guide is divided into multiple labs, each covering a separate use case that showcases different features for a real-world scenario.

### Prerequisites
* Understanding of [Discrete Global Grid H3](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/getting-started-with-h3-hexagonal-grid/)
* Recommend: Understanding of [Geospatial Data Types](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-geospatial) and [Geospatial Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-geospatial) in Snowflake
* Recommended: Complete [Geospatial Analysis using Geometry and Geography Data Types](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/geo_analysis_geometry/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) quickstart
* Recommended: Complete [Performance Optimization Techniques for Geospatial queries](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/geo_performance/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) quickstart

### What You’ll Learn
In this quickstart, you will use H3, Time Series, Cortex ML and Streamlit for ML use cases. The quickstart is broken up into separate labs:
* Lab 1: Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding
* Lab 2: Forecasting time series on a map
* Lab 3: Sentiment analysis of customer reviews

When you complete this quickstart, you will have gained practical experience in several areas:
* Acquiring data from the Snowflake Marketplace
* Loading data from external storage
* Transforming data using H3 and Time Series functions
* Training models and predicting results with Cortex ML
* Using LLM for analysing textual data
* Visualizing data with Streamlit

### What You’ll Need
* A supported Snowflake [Browser](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/setup.html)
* Sign-up for a [Snowflake Trial](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_) OR have access to an existing Snowflake account with the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or the `IMPORT SHARE `privilege. Select the Enterprise edition, AWS as a cloud provider and US East (Northern Virginia) or EU (Frankfurt) as a region.

<!-- ----------------------------------------- -->

## Setup your Account

Duration: 10

If this is the first time you are logging into the Snowflake UI, you will be prompted to enter your account name or account URL that you were given when you acquired a trial. The account URL contains your [account name](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/connecting.html#your-snowflake-account-name) and potentially the region. You can find your account URL in the email that was sent to you after you signed up for the trial.

Click `Sign-in` and you will be prompted for your username and password.

> aside positive
>  If this is not the first time you are logging into the Snowflake UI, you should see a "Select an account to sign into" prompt and a button for your account name listed below it. Click the account you wish to access and you will be prompted for your user name and password (or another authentication mechanism).

### Increase Your Account Permission
The Snowflake web interface has a lot to offer, but for now, switch your current role from the default `SYSADMIN` to `ACCOUNTADMIN`. This increase in permissions will allow you to create shared databases from Snowflake Marketplace listings.

> aside positive
>  If you don't have the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role, switch to a role with `IMPORT SHARE` privileges instead.

### Create a Virtual Warehouse

You will need to create a Virtual Warehouse to run queries.

* Navigate to the `Admin > Warehouses` screen using the menu on the left side of the window
* Click the big blue `+ Warehouse` button in the upper right of the window
* Create a LARGE Warehouse as shown in the screen below

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_2.png' width=500>

Be sure to change the `Suspend After (min)` field to 5 min to avoid wasting compute credits.

Navigate to the query editor by clicking on `Worksheets` on the top left navigation bar and choose your warehouse.

- Click the + Worksheet button in the upper right of your browser window. This will open a new window.
- In the new Window, make sure `ACCOUNTADMIN` and `MY_WH` (or whatever your warehouse is named) are selected in the upper right of your browser window.

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_3.png' width=700>

Create a new database and schema where you will store datasets in the `GEOGRAPHY` data type. Copy & paste the SQL below into your worksheet editor, put your cursor somewhere in the text of the query you want to run (usually the beginning or end), and either click the blue "Play" button in the upper right of your browser window, or press `CTRL+Enter` or `CMD+Enter` (Windows or Mac) to run the query.

```
CREATE DATABASE advanced_analytics;
// Set the working database schema
USE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC;
USE WAREHOUSE my_wh;
ALTER SESSION SET GEOGRAPHY_OUTPUT_FORMAT='WKT';
```

>  This lab is [available](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sf-guide-geospatial-analytics-ai-ml) as Snowflake Notebook.

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding using datasets and applications from the Marketplace. You will learn how to:
- Perform address cleansing
- Convert an address into a location (geocoding)
- Convert a location into an address (reverse geocoding)

For the most precise and reliable geocoding results, we recommend using specialized services like [Mapbox](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0ZIFQPEA/mapbox-mapbox-geocoding-analysis-tools) or [TravelTime](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ2FSZKSSH1/traveltime-technologies-ltd-traveltime). While the methods described in this Lab can be useful, they may not always achieve the highest accuracy, especially in areas with sparse data or complex geographic features. If your application demands extremely precise geocoding, consider investing in a proven solution with guaranteed accuracy and robust support.

However, many companies seek cost-effective solutions for geocoding large datasets. In such cases, supplementing specialized services with free datasets can be a viable approach. Datasets provided by the [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) or [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) can be valuable resources for building solutions that are "good enough", especially when some accuracy can be compromised in favor of cost-efficiency. It's essential to evaluate your specific needs and constraints before selecting a geocoding approach.

### Step 1. Data acquisition

For this project you will use a dataset with locations of restaurants and cafes in Berlin from the [CARTO Academy](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0Z4CM1E9J2/carto-carto-academy-data-for-tutorials) Marketplace listing.
* Navigate to the `Marketplace` screen using the menu on the left side of the window
* Search for `CARTO Academy` in the search bar
* Find and click the `CARTO Academy - Data for tutorials` tile
* Once in the listing, click the big blue `Get` button

> aside negative
>  On the `Get` screen, you may be prompted to complete your `user profile` if you have not done so before. Click the link as shown in the screenshot below. Enter your name and email address into the profile screen and click the blue `Save` button. You will be returned to the `Get` screen.

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_10.png' width=500>

Another dataset that you will use in this Lab is [Worldwide Address Data](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSNZ7F5UT/starschema-worldwide-address-data) and you can also get it from the Snowflake Marketplace. It's a free dataset from the OpenAddresses project that allows Snowflake customers to map lat/long information to address details. 
- Search for `Worldwide Address Data` in the search bar
- Find and click on the corresponding dataset from Starschema

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_20.png' width=800>

- On the `Get Data` screen, don't change the name of the database from `WORLDWIDE_ADDRESS_DATA`.
 
<img src ='assets/geo_ml_21.png' width=500>

Nice! You have just got two listings that you will need for this project.

### Step 2. Data Preparation
To showcase geocoding techniques in this lab, and to evaluate the quality of our approach you will use a table `CARTO_ACADEMY__DATA_FOR_TUTORIALS.CARTO.DATAAPPEAL_RESTAURANTS_AND_CAFES_BERLIN_CPG` with locations of restaurants and cafes in Berlin. If you look into that table you will notice that some records don't have full or correct information in the `STREET_ADDRESS` column. To be able to calculate the correct quality metrics in this lab lets do a simple cleanup of the low quality datapoint. Run the following query to create a table that has only records that have 5-digits postcode and those records are in Berlin.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_ADDRESSES AS
SELECT * 
FROM CARTO_ACADEMY__DATA_FOR_TUTORIALS.CARTO.DATAAPPEAL_RESTAURANTS_AND_CAFES_BERLIN_CPG
WHERE REGEXP_SUBSTR(street_address, '(\\d{5})') is not null
AND city ILIKE 'berlin';
```
If you check the size of `ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_ADDRESSES` table you'll see that it has about 10K rows.

The Worldwide Address Data dataset contains more than 500M addresses around the world and we will use it for geocoding and reverse geocoding. However some addresses in that dataset contain addresses with coordinates outside of the allowed boundaries for latitude and longitude. Run the following query to create a new table that filters out those "invalid" records and includes a new column, `LOCATION`, which stores the locations in the `GEOGRAPHY` type:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.OPENADDRESS AS
SELECT ST_POINT(lon, lat) as location, *
FROM WORLDWIDE_ADDRESS_DATA.ADDRESS.OPENADDRESS
WHERE lon between -180 and 180
AND lat between -90 and 90;
```

Now when all your data is ready and clean, you can proceed to the actual use cases.


### Step 2. Data Cleansing
Customer-provided address data is often incomplete or contains spelling mistakes. If you plan to perform geocoding on that data, it would be a good idea to include address cleansing as a preparation step.

In this step, you will prepare a prompt to run the data cleansing. For this task, you will use the [CORTEX.COMPLETE()](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/complete-snowflake-cortex) function because it is purpose-built for data processing and data generation tasks. First, let's create a Cortex role. In the query below, replace AA with the username you used to log in to Snowflake.

```
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS cortex_user_role;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

GRANT ROLE cortex_user_role TO USER AA;
```
You are now ready to provide the CORTEX.COMPLETE() function with instructions on how to perform address cleansing. Specifically, using a table of Berlin restaurants, you'll create a new table with an additional column `parsed_address`, which is the result of the `CORTEX.COMPLETE()` function. For complex processing like this, you will use [mistral-8x7b](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions#availability), a very capable open-source LLM created by Mistral AI. Essentially, we want to parse the address stored as a single string into a JSON object that contains each component of the address as a separate key.

As a general rule when writing a prompt, the instructions should be simple, clear, and complete. For example, you should clearly define the task as parsing an address into a JSON object. It's important to define the constraints of the desired output; otherwise, the LLM may produce unexpected results. Below, you specifically instruct the LLM to parse the address stored as text and explicitly tell it to respond in JSON format.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES as
SELECT geom, geoid, street_address, name,
    snowflake.cortex.complete('mixtral-8x7b', 
    concat('Task: Your job is to return a JSON formatted response that normalizes, standardizes, and enriches the following address,
            filling in any missing information when needed: ', street_address, 
            'Requirements: Return only in valid JSON format (starting with { and ending with }).
            The JSON response should include the following fields:
            "number": <<house_number>>,
            "street": <<street_name>>,
            "city": <<city_name>>,
            "postcode": <<postcode_value>>,
            "country": <<ISO_3166-1_alpha-2_country_code>>.
            Values inside <<>> must be replaced with the corresponding details from the address provided.
            - If a value cannot be determined, use "Null".
            - No additional fields or classifications should be included beyond the five categories listed.
            - Country code must follow the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.
            - Do not add comments or any other non-JSON text.
            - Use Latin characters for street names and cities, avoiding Unicode alternatives.
            Examples:
            Input: "123 Mn Stret, San Franscico, CA"
            Output: {"number": "123", "street": "Main Street", "city": "San Francisco", "postcode": "94105", "country": "US"}
            Input: "45d Park Avnue, New Yrok, NY 10016"
            Output: {"number": "45d", "street": "Park Avenue", "city": "New York", "postcode": "10016", "country": "US"}
            Input: "10 Downig Stret, Londn, SW1A 2AA, United Knidom"
            Output: {"number": "10", "street": "Downing Street", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1A 2AA", "country": "UK"}
            Input: "4 Avneu des Champs Elyses, Paris, France"
            Output: {"number": "4", "street": "Avenue des Champs-Élysées", "city": "Paris", "postcode": "75008", "country": "FR"}
            Input: "1600 Amiphiteatro Parkway, Montain View, CA 94043, USA"
            Output: {"number": "1600", "street": "Amphitheatre Parkway", "city": "Mountain View", "postcode": "94043", "country": "US"}
            Input: "Plaza de Espana, 28c, Madird, Spain"
            Output: {"number": "28c", "street": "Plaza de España", "city": "Madrid", "postcode": "28008", "country": "ES"}
            Input: "1d Prinzessinenstrase, Berlín, 10969, Germany"
            Output: {"number": "1d", "street": "Prinzessinnenstraße", "city": "Berlin", "postcode": "10969", "country": "DE"} ')) as parsed_address 
        FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_ADDRESSES;
```

On a `LARGE` warehouse, which we used in this quickstart, the query completed in about 13 minutes. However, on a smaller warehouse, the completion time is roughly the same. We don't recommend using a warehouse larger than `MEDIUM` for CORTEX LLM functions, as it won't significantly reduce execution time. If you plan to execute complex processing with LLM on a large dataset, it's better to split the dataset into chunks up to 100K rows each and run multiple jobs in parallel using an `X-Small` warehouse. A rule of thumb is that on an `X-Small`, data cleansing of 1,000 rows can be done within 90 seconds, which costs about 5 cents.

Now, you will convert the parsed address into JSON type:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES AS
SELECT geoid, geom, street_address, name,
TRY_PARSE_JSON(parsed_address) AS parsed_address,
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES;
```

Run the following query to check what the result of cleansing looks like in the `PARSED_ADDRESS` column and compare it with the actual address in the `STREET_ADDRESS` column.

```
ALTER SESSION SET GEOGRAPHY_OUTPUT_FORMAT='WKT';

SELECT TOP 10 * FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES;
```

You also can notice that 23 addresses were not correctly parsed, but if you look into the `STREET_ADDRESS` column of those records using the following query, you can understand why they were not parsed: in most cases there are some address elements missing in the initial address.

```
SELECT * FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES
WHERE parsed_address IS NULL;
```

### Step3. Geocoding

In this step, you will use the Worldwide Address Data to perform geocoding. You will join this dataset with your cleansed address data using country, city, postal code, street, and building number as keys. For street name comparison, you will use [Jaro-Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) to measure similarity between the two strings. You should use a sufficiently high similarity threshold but not 100%, which would imply exact matches. Approximate similarity is necessary to account for potential variations in street names, such as "Street" versus "Straße".

To the initial table with actual location and address, you will add columns with geocoded and parsed values for country, city, postcode, street, and building number. Run the following query:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODED AS
SELECT 
    t1.name,
    t1.geom AS actual_location,
    t2.location AS geocoded_location, 
    t1.street_address as actual_address,
    t2.street as geocoded_street, 
    t2.postcode as geocoded_postcode, 
    t2.number as geocoded_number, 
    t2.city as geocoded_city
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES t1
LEFT JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.OPENADDRESS t2
ON t1.parsed_address:postcode::string = t2.postcode
AND t1.parsed_address:number::string = t2.number
AND LOWER(t1.parsed_address:country::string) = LOWER(t2.country)
AND LOWER(t1.parsed_address:city::string) = LOWER(t2.city)
AND JAROWINKLER_SIMILARITY(LOWER(t1.parsed_address:street::string), LOWER(t2.street)) > 95;
```

Now let's analyze the results of geocoding and compare the locations we obtained after geocoding with the original addresses. First, let's see how many addresses we were not able to geocode using this approach.

```
SELECT count(*) FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODED
WHERE geocoded_location IS NULL;
```

It turned out that 2,081 addresses were not geocoded, which is around 21% of the whole dataset. Let's see how many geocoded addresses deviate from the original location by more than 200 meters.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODED
WHERE ST_DISTANCE(actual_location, geocoded_location) > 200;
```

It seems there are 174 addresses. Let's examine random records from these 174 addresses individually by running the query below. You can visualize coordinates from the table with results using [this](https://clydedacruz.github.io/openstreetmap-wkt-playground/) service (copy-paste `GEOCODED_LOCATION` and `ACTUAL_LOCATION` values). 

```
SELECT * FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODED
WHERE ST_DISTANCE(actual_location, geocoded_location) > 200;
```

You can see that in many cases, our geocoding provided the correct location for the given address, while the original location point actually corresponds to a different address. Therefore, our approach returned more accurate locations than those in the original dataset. Sometimes, the "ground truth" data contains incorrect data points.

In this exercise, you successfully geocoded more than 78% of the entire dataset. To geocode the remaining addresses that were not geocoded using this approach, you can use paid services such as [Mapbox](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0ZIFQPEA/mapbox-mapbox-geocoding-analysis-tools) or [TravelTime](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ2FSZKSSH1/traveltime-technologies-ltd-traveltime). However, you managed to reduce the geocoding cost by more than four times compared to what it would have been if you had used those services for the entire dataset.

### Step 4. Reverse Geocoding

In the next step, we will do the opposite - for a given location, we will get the address. Often, companies have location information and need to convert it into the actual address. Similar to the previous example, the best way to do reverse geocoding is to use specialized services, such as Mapbox or TravelTime. However, there are cases where you're ready to trade off between accuracy and cost. For example, if you don't need an exact address but a zip code would be good enough. In this case, you can use free datasets to perform reverse geocoding.

To complete this exercise, we will use the nearest neighbor approach. For locations in our test dataset (`ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_ADDRESSES` table), you will find the closest locations from the Worldwide Address Data. Let's first create a procedure that, for each row in the given table with addresses, finds the closest address from the Worldwide Address Data table within the radius of 5km. To speed up the function we will apply an iterative approach to the neighbor search - start from 10 meters and increase the search radius until a match is found or the maximum radius is reached. Run the following query:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GEOCODING_EXACT(
    NAME_FOR_RESULT_TABLE TEXT,
    LOCATIONS_TABLE_NAME TEXT,
    LOCATIONS_ID_COLUMN_NAME TEXT,
    LOCATIONS_COLUMN_NAME TEXT,
    WWAD_TABLE_NAME TEXT,

)

        -- Double the radius for the next iteration.
        RADIUS := RADIUS * 2;
    END FOR;
END
$$;
```
Run the next query to call that procedure and store results of reverse geocoding to `ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED` table:

```
CALL GEOCODING_EXACT('ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED', 'ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_ADDRESSES', 'GEOID', 'GEOM', 'ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.OPENADDRESS', 'LOCATION');
```
This query completed in 5.5 minutes on `LARGE` warehouse, which corresponds to about 2 USD. Let's now compare the address we get after the reverse geocoding (`ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED` table) with the table that has the original address.

```
SELECT t1.geoid, 
    t2.street_address AS actual_address,
    t1.street || ' ' || t1.number || ', ' || t1.postcode || ' ' || t1.city  || ', ' || t1.country AS geocoded_address
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED t1
INNER JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES t2
    ON t1.geoid = t2.geoid
WHERE t1.distance < 100;
```

For 9830 records, the closest addresses we found are within 100 meters from the original address. This corresponds to 98.7% of cases. As we mentioned earlier, often for analysis you might not need the full address, and knowing a postcode is already good enough. Run the following query to see for how many records the geocoded postcode is the same as the original postcode:

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED t1
INNER JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES t2
    ON t1.geoid = t2.geoid
WHERE t2.parsed_address:postcode::string = t1.postcode::string;
```

This query returned 9564 records,  about 96% of the dataset, which is quite a good result.

Out of curiosity, let's see, for how many addresses the geocoded and initial address is the same up until the street name. Run the following query:

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED t1
INNER JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES t2
    ON t1.geoid = t2.geoid
WHERE t2.parsed_address:postcode::string = t1.postcode
AND LOWER(t2.parsed_address:country::string) = LOWER(t1.country)
AND LOWER(t2.parsed_address:city::string) = LOWER(t1.city)
AND JAROWINKLER_SIMILARITY(LOWER(t2.parsed_address:street::string), LOWER(t1.street)) > 95;
```

82% of addresses correctly geocoded up to the street name. And to have a full picture, let's see how many records have the fully identical original and geocoded address:

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.REVERSE_GEOCODED t1
INNER JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.GEOCODING_CLEANSED_ADDRESSES t2
    ON t1.geoid = t2.geoid
WHERE t2.parsed_address:postcode::string = t1.postcode
AND t2.parsed_address:number::string = t1.number
AND LOWER(t2.parsed_address:country::string) = LOWER(t1.country)
AND LOWER(t2.parsed_address:city::string) = LOWER(t1.city)
AND JAROWINKLER_SIMILARITY(LOWER(t2.parsed_address:street::string), LOWER(t1.street)) > 95;
```

For 61% of addresses we were able to do reverse geocoding that matches reference dataset up to the rooftop.

### Conclusion

In this lab, you have learned how to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding using free datasets and open-source tools. While this approach may not provide the highest possible accuracy, it offers a cost-effective solution for processing large datasets where some degree of inaccuracy is acceptable. It's important to mention that Worldwide Address Data that has more than 500M addresses  for the whole world is one of many free datasets that you can get from Snowflake Marketplace and use for geocoding use cases. There are others, which you might consider for your use cases, here are just some examples:
- [Overture Maps - Addresses](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0Z4CM1E9NQ/carto-overture-maps-addresses) - if you mainly need to geocode addresses in North America, another good option would be to use this dataset that has more than 200M addresses.
- [US Addresses & PO](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KIA/cybersyn-us-addresses-poi) - has more than 150M rows can be used as a source of information around locations of Points of Interests.
- [French National Addresses](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT1ZQXT8U/atos-french-national-addresses) - contains about 26M addresses in France.
- [Dutch Addresses & Buildings Registration (BAG)](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ1M7Z62O2A/tensing-dutch-addresses-buildings-registration-bag) - includes Dutch Addresses.

There is a high chance that datasets focused on particular counties have richer and more accurate data for those countries. And by amending queries from this lab you can find the best option for your needs. 


## Forecasting time series on a map

Duration: 40

> aside negative
>  Before starting with this lab, complete preparation steps from `Setup your account` page.

In this lab, we aim to show you how to predict the number of trips in the coming hours in each area of New York. To accomplish this, you will ingest the raw data and then aggregate it by hour and region. For simplicity, you will use [Discrete Global Grid H3](https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/h3/). The result will be an hourly time series, each representing the count of trips originating from distinct areas. Before running prediction and visualizing results, you will enrich data with third-party signals, such as information about holidays and offline sports events.

In this lab you will learn how to:
* Work with geospatial data
* Enrich data with new features
* Predict time-series of complex structure

This approach is not unique to trip forecasting but is equally applicable in various scenarios where predictive analysis is required. Examples include forecasting scooter or bike pickups, food delivery orders, sales across multiple retail outlets, or predicting the volume of cash withdrawals across an ATM network. Such models are invaluable for planning and optimization across various industries and services.

### Step 1. Data acquisition

The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided detailed, anonymized customer travel data since 2009. Painted yellow cars can pick up passengers in any of the city's five boroughs. Raw data on yellow taxi rides can be found on the [TLC website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). This data is divided into files by month. Each file contains detailed trip information, you can read about it [here](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf). For our project, you will use an NY Taxi dataset for the 2014-2015 years from the [CARTO Academy](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0Z4CM1E9J2/carto-carto-academy-data-for-tutorials) Marketplace listing.
* Navigate to the `Marketplace` screen using the menu on the left side of the window
* Search for `CARTO Academy` in the search bar
* Find and click the `CARTO Academy - Data for tutorials` tile
* Once in the listing, click the big blue `Get` button

> aside negative
>  On the `Get` screen, you may be prompted to complete your `user profile` if you have not done so before. Click the link as shown in the screenshot below. Enter your name and email address into the profile screen and click the blue `Save` button. You will be returned to the `Get` screen.

Another dataset you will use is events data and you can also get it from the Snowflake Marketplace. It is provided by PredictHQ and called [PredictHQ Quickstart Demo](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSTZ3TGTNLQM/predicthq-quickstart-demo).
* Search for` PredictHQ Quickstart Demo` in the search bar
* Find and click the `Quickstart Demo` tile

Congratulations! You have just created a shared database from a listing on the Snowflake Marketplace. 

### Step 2. Data transformation

In this step, you'll divide New York into uniformly sized regions and assign each taxi pick-up location to one of these regions. We aim to get a table with the number of taxi trips per hour for each region.

To achieve this division, you will use the Discrete Global Grid H3. H3 organizes the world into a grid of equal-sized hexagonal cells, with each cell identified by a unique code (either a string or an integer). This hierarchical grid system allows cells to be combined into larger cells or subdivided into smaller ones, facilitating efficient geospatial data processing.

H3 offers 16 different resolutions for dividing areas into hexagons, ranging from resolution 0, where the world is segmented into 122 large hexagons, to resolution 15. At this resolution, each hexagon is less than a square meter, covering the world with approximately 600 trillion hexagons. You can read more about resolutions [here](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/). For our task, we will use resolution 8, where the size of each hexagon is about 0.7 sq. km (0.3 sq. miles).

As a source of the trips data you will use `TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014` and `TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015` tables from the CARTO listing. We are interested in the following fields:
* Pickup Time
* Dropoff Time
* Pickup Latitude
* Pickup Longitude
* Dropoff Latitude
* Dropoff Longitude

First, specify the default Database, Schema and the Warehouse:
```
USE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC;
USE WAREHOUSE my_wh;
```

Since CARTO's tables contain raw data you might want to clean it before storing. In the following query you will do a few data cleaning steps:
* Remove rows that are outside of latitude/longitude allowed values
* Keep only trips with a duration longer than one minute and distances more than 10 meters.

And since you are interested in trip data for 2014 and 2015 you need to union `TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014` and `TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015` tables. On average, the execution time on the LARGE warehouse is under 4 minutes.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides AS
SELECT CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', to_timestamp(PICKUP_DATETIME::varchar)) PICKUP_TIME,
       CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', to_timestamp(DROPOFF_DATETIME::varchar)) DROPOFF_TIME,
       st_point(PICKUP_LONGITUDE, PICKUP_LATITUDE) AS PICKUP_LOCATION,
       st_point(DROPOFF_LONGITUDE, DROPOFF_LATITUDE) AS DROPOFF_LOCATION,
FROM CARTO_ACADEMY__DATA_FOR_TUTORIALS.CARTO.TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014
WHERE pickup_latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90
  AND dropoff_latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90
  AND pickup_longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180
  AND dropoff_longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180
  AND st_distance(st_point(PICKUP_LONGITUDE, PICKUP_LATITUDE), st_point(DROPOFF_LONGITUDE, DROPOFF_LATITUDE)) > 10
  AND TIMEDIFF(MINUTE, PICKUP_TIME, DROPOFF_TIME) > 1
UNION ALL
SELECT CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', to_timestamp(PICKUP_DATETIME::varchar)) PICKUP_TIME,
       CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', to_timestamp(DROPOFF_DATETIME::varchar)) DROPOFF_TIME,
       st_point(PICKUP_LONGITUDE, PICKUP_LATITUDE) AS PICKUP_LOCATION,
       st_point(DROPOFF_LONGITUDE, DROPOFF_LATITUDE) AS DROPOFF_LOCATION,
FROM CARTO_ACADEMY__DATA_FOR_TUTORIALS.CARTO.TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015
WHERE pickup_latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90
  AND dropoff_latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90
  AND pickup_longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180
  AND dropoff_longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180
  AND st_distance(PICKUP_LOCATION, DROPOFF_LOCATION) > 10
  AND TIMEDIFF(MINUTE, PICKUP_TIME, DROPOFF_TIME) > 1;
```

Now you will create a table where, for each pair of timestamp/H3, we calculate the number of trips. You will strip off minutes and seconds and keep only hours.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 AS
SELECT TIME_SLICE(pickup_time, 60, 'minute', 'START') AS pickup_time,
       H3_POINT_TO_CELL_string(pickup_location, 8) AS h3,
       count(*) AS pickups
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

Since on resolution 8, you might have more than 1000 hexagons for New York, to speed up the training process, you will keep only hexagons that had more than 1M pickups in 2014.  This is shown in the following code block. 

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 
AS WITH all_hexagons AS
  (SELECT h3,
          SUM(pickups) AS total_pickups
   FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3
   WHERE year(pickup_time) = 2014
   GROUP BY 1)
SELECT t1.*
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 t1
INNER JOIN all_hexagons t2 ON t1.h3 = t2.h3
WHERE total_pickups >= 1000000;
```

It's important to remember that if the raw data lacks records for a specific hour and area combination, the aggregated data for that period should be marked as 0. This step is crucial for accurate time series prediction. Run the following query to add records indicating that there were zero trips for any H3 location and timestamp pair without recorded trips.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 AS
WITH all_dates_hexagons AS (
    SELECT DATEADD(HOUR, VALUE::int, '2014-01-01'::timestamp) AS pickup_time, h3
    FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(ARRAY_GENERATE_RANGE(0, DATEDIFF('hour', '2014-01-01', '2015-12-31 23:59:00') + 1)))
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT h3 FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3)
)
SELECT t1.pickup_time, 
t1.h3, IFF(t2.pickups IS NOT NULL, t2.pickups, 0) AS pickups
FROM all_dates_hexagons t1
LEFT JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 t2 
ON t1.pickup_time = t2.pickup_time AND t1.h3 = t2.h3;
```

### Step 4. Data Enrichment

In this step, you will enhance our dataset with extra features that could improve the accuracy of our predictions. Cortex model for time series automatically encodes days of the week as a separate feature, but it makes sense to consider that public or school holidays could affect the demand for taxi services. Likewise, areas hosting sporting events might experience a surge in taxi pickups. To incorporate this insight, you will use data from [PredictHQ - Quickstart Demo](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSTZ3TGTNLQM/predicthq-quickstart-demo) listing, which provides information on events in New York for the years 2014-2015.

Run the following query to enrich the data with holiday, and event information. For sports events, you will include only those with a high rank.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 AS
SELECT t1.*,
       IFF(t2.category = 'school-holidays', 'school-holidays', 'None') AS school_holiday,
       IFF(t3.category = 'public-holidays', ARRAY_TO_STRING(t3.labels, ', '), 'None') AS public_holiday,
       IFF(t4.category = 'sports', t4.labels[0]::string, 'None') AS sport_event
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 t1
LEFT JOIN (SELECT distinct title, category, event_start, event_end, labels 
           FROM QUICKSTART_DEMO.PREDICTHQ.PREDICTHQ_EVENTS_SNOWFLAKE_SUMMIT_2024 
           WHERE category = 'school-holidays' and title ilike 'New York%') t2 
    ON DATE(t1.pickup_time) between t2.event_start AND t2.event_end
LEFT JOIN (SELECT distinct title, category, event_start, event_end, labels 
           FROM QUICKSTART_DEMO.PREDICTHQ.PREDICTHQ_EVENTS_SNOWFLAKE_SUMMIT_2024 
           WHERE array_contains('holiday-national'::variant, labels)) t3 
    ON DATE(t1.pickup_time) between t3.event_start AND t3.event_end
LEFT JOIN (SELECT * from QUICKSTART_DEMO.PREDICTHQ.PREDICTHQ_EVENTS_SNOWFLAKE_SUMMIT_2024 
           WHERE phq_rank > 70 and category = 'sports') t4 
    ON t1.pickup_time = date_trunc('hour', t4.event_start) 
    AND t1.h3 = h3_point_to_cell_string(t4.geo, 8);
```

### Step 5. Training and Prediction

In this step, you'll divide our dataset into two parts: the Training set and the Prediction set. The Training set will be used to train our machine learning model. It will include data from the entirety of 2014 and part of 2015, going up to June 5th, 2015. Run the following query to create the Training set:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3_TRAIN AS
SELECT *
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3
WHERE date(pickup_time) < date('2015-06-05 12:00:00');
```

The prediction set, on the other hand, will contain data for one week starting June 5th, 2015. This setup allows us to make predictions on data that wasn't used during training.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3_PREDICT AS
SELECT h3,
       pickup_time,
       SCHOOL_HOLIDAY,
       PUBLIC_HOLIDAY,
       SPORT_EVENT
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3
WHERE date(pickup_time) >= date('2015-06-05')
AND date(pickup_time) < date('2015-06-12');
```

Now that you have the Training and Prediction sets, you can run your model training step. In this step, you will use Snowflake’s Cortex ML Forecasting function to train your `ny_taxi_rides_model`. You’re telling the function it should train on `ny_taxi_rides_h3_train` – and that this table contains data for multiple distinct time series (`series_colname => ‘h3’`),  one for each h3 in the table. The function will now automatically train one machine learning model for each h3. Note that you are also telling the model which column in our table to use as a timestamp and which column to treat as our “target” (i.e., the column you want to forecast). On average the query below completes in about 7 minutes on the LARGE warehouse.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE snowflake.ml.forecast ny_taxi_rides_model(
  input_data => system$reference('table', 'ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3_TRAIN'), 
  series_colname => 'h3', 
  timestamp_colname => 'pickup_time', 
  target_colname => 'pickups');
```

Now you will predict the "future" demand for one week of test data. Run the following command to forecast demand for each H3 cell ID  and store your results in the "forecasts" table.

Similar to what you did in the training step, you specify the data the model should use to generate its forecasts (`ny_taxi_rides_h3_predict`) and indicate which columns to use for identifying unique H3 and for timestamps. 

```
BEGIN
    CALL ny_taxi_rides_model!FORECAST(
        INPUT_DATA => SYSTEM$REFERENCE('TABLE', 'ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3_PREDICT'),
        SERIES_COLNAME => 'h3',
        TIMESTAMP_COLNAME => 'pickup_time',
        CONFIG_OBJECT => {'prediction_interval': 0.95}
    );
    -- These steps store your predictions to a table.
    LET x := SQLID;
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_model_forecast AS 
    SELECT series::string as h3,
    ts AS pickup_time,
    -- If any forecasts or prediction intervals are negative you need to convert them to zero. 
    CASE WHEN forecast < 0 THEN 0 ELSE forecast END AS forecast,
    CASE WHEN lower_bound < 0 THEN 0 ELSE lower_bound END AS lower_bound,
    CASE WHEN upper_bound < 0 THEN 0 ELSE upper_bound END AS upper_bound
    FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(:x));
END;
```
Create a table with predicted and actual results:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_compare AS
SELECT t1.h3, 
       t1.pickup_time, 
       t2.pickups, 
       round(t1.forecast, 0) as forecast
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_model_forecast t1
INNER JOIN ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.NY_TAXI_RIDES_H3 t2
ON t1.h3 = t2.h3
AND t1.pickup_time = t2.pickup_time;
```

Now you will generate evaluation metrics and store them in the `ny_taxi_rides_metrics` table:

```
BEGIN
    CALL ny_taxi_rides_model!show_evaluation_metrics();
    LET x := SQLID;
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_metrics AS 
    SELECT series::string as h3,
           metric_value,
           error_metric
    FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(:x));
END;
```

The table `ny_taxi_rides_metrics` contains various metrics; please review what is available in the table. You should select a metric that allows uniform comparisons across all hexagons to understand the model's performance in each hexagon. Since trip volumes may vary among hexagons, the chosen metric should not be sensitive to absolute values. The Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error ([SMAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error)) would be a suitable choice. Create a table with the list of hexagons and the SMAPE value for each:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_metrics AS
SELECT h3, metric_value AS smape 
FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ny_taxi_rides_metrics
WHERE error_metric::string = 'SMAPE'
order by 2 asc;
```

### Step 6. Visualization and analysis

In this step, you will visualize the actual and predicted results and think on how you can improve our model. Open `Projects > Streamlit > + Streamlit App`. Give the new app a name, for example `Demand Prediction - model analysis`, and pick `ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC` as an app location.

After clicking `Run` button you will see the following UI:

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_14.png'>

Click `Expand to see SMAPE metric` in the sidebar and find hexagons with good/bad MAPE values. Find them on the map using `H3 cells to display` dropdown.

As you can see, overall, the model is quite good, with SMAPE below 0.3 for most of the hexagons. Even with its current quality, the model can already be used to predict future demand. However, let's still consider how you can improve it.

The worst predictions are for hexagons corresponding to LaGuardia Airport (`882a100e25fffff`, `882a100f57fffff`, `882a100f53fffff`). To address this, you might consider adding information about flight arrivals and departures, which could improve the model's quality. It is a bit surprising to see poor quality at the hexagon `882a100897fffff`, which is close to Central Park. However, it seems that June 7th is the main driver of the poor prediction, as model significantly underpredicted during both day and night hours.

<img src ='assets/geo_ml_9.png' width = 600>

You have information about public and school holidays and sports events among our features. Perhaps adding information about other local events, such as festivals, could improve the overall quality of the model.

## Customer Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Duration: 40

> aside negative
>  Before starting with this lab, complete the preparation steps from `Setup your account` page.

This lab will show you how to inject AI into your spatial analysis using Cortex Large Language Model (LLM) Functions to help you take your product and marketing strategy to the next level. Specifically, you’re going to build a data application that gives food delivery companies the ability to explore the sentiments of customers in the Greater Bay Area. To do this, you use the Cortex LLM Complete Function to classify customer sentiment and extract the underlying reasons for that sentiment from a customer review. Then you use the Discrete [Global Grid H3](https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/h3/) for visualizing and exploring spatial data. 

### Step 1. Data acquisition

To complete the project you will use a synthetic dataset with delivery orders with the feedback for each order. We will simplify the task of data acquisition by putting the dataset in an S3 bucket, which you will connect as an external stage.

First specify the default Database, Schema and the Warehouse and create a file format that corresponds to the format of the trip and holiday data we stored in S3. Run the following queries:
```
USE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC;
USE WAREHOUSE my_wh;
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT csv_format_nocompression TYPE = csv
FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' skip_header = 1;
```
Now you will create an external stage using S3 with test data:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE aa_stage URL = 's3://sfquickstarts/hol_geo_spatial_ml_using_snowflake_cortex/';
```
Then create a table where you will store the customer feedback dataset:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS AS
SELECT  $1::NUMBER as order_id,
        $2::VARCHAR as customer_id,
        TO_GEOGRAPHY($3) as delivery_location,
        $4::NUMBER as delivery_postcode,
        $5::FLOAT as delivery_distance_miles,
        $6::VARCHAR as restaurant_food_type,
        TO_GEOGRAPHY($7) as restaurant_location,
        $8::NUMBER as restaurant_postcode,
        $9::VARCHAR as restaurant_id,
        $10::VARCHAR as review
FROM @ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.AA_STAGE/food_delivery_reviews.csv (file_format => 'csv_format_nocompression');
```

Congratulations!  Now you have `orders_reviews` table containing 100K orders with reviews.

### Step 2. Preparing and running the prompt

In this step, you will prepare the prompt to run the analysis. For the task at hand, you will use the CORTEX.COMPLETE ( ) function because it is purpose-built to power data processing and data generation tasks. First, let's create a cortex role. In the query below change the username AA to the username you used to login to Snowflake.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE cortex_user_role;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

GRANT ROLE cortex_user_role TO USER AA;
```

You are now ready to provide CORTEX.COMPLETE ( ) functions with the instructions on the analysis that you want to produce. Specifically, using a raw table with reviews you'll create a new table with two additional columns: Overall Sentiment and Sentiment Categories which are composed of two different CORTEX.COMPLETE ( ) prompts. For complex aspect-based sentiment analysis like this, you are going to pick the mixtral-8x7b, a very capable open-source LLM created by Mistral AI. 
* **Overall Sentiment** assigns an overall rating of the delivery: Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Mixed, Negative, Very Negative, or other. 
* **Sentiment Categories** give us richer insights into why the overall rating is based on Food Cost, Quality, and Delivery Time. 

As a general rule when writing a prompt, the instructions have to be simple, clear, and complete. For example, you will notice that you clearly define the task as classifying customer reviews into specific categories. It’s important to define constraints of the desired output, otherwise the LLM will produce unexpected output. Below, you specifically tell the LLM to categorize anything it is not sure of as Other, and explicitly tell it to respond in JSON format. 


```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT_TEST as
SELECT TOP 10
    order_id
    , customer_id
    , delivery_location
    , delivery_postcode
    , delivery_distance_miles
    , restaurant_food_type
    , restaurant_location
    , restaurant_postcode
    , restaurant_id
    , review
    , snowflake.cortex.complete('mixtral-8x7b'
        , concat('You are a helpful data assistant and your job is to return a JSON formatted response that classifies a customer review (represented in the <review> section) as one of the following seven sentiment categories (represented in the <categories> section). Return your classification exclusively in the JSON format: {classification: <<value>>}, where <<value>> is one of the 7 classification categories in the section <categories>. 
        
        <categories>
        Very Positive
        Positive
        Neutral
        Mixed 
        Negative 
        Very Negative
        Other
        </categories>
        
        "Other" should be used for the classification if you are unsure of what to put. No other classifications apart from these seven in the <categories> section should be used.
        
        Here are some examples: 
            1. If review is: "This place is awesome! The food tastes great, delivery was super fast, and the cost was cheap. Amazing!", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Very Positive"}
            2. If review is: "Tried this new place and it was a good experience. Good food delivered fast.", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Positive"}
            3. If review is: "Got food from this new joint. It was OK. Nothing special but nothing to complain about either", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Neural"}
            4. If review is: "The pizza place we ordered from had the food delivered real quick and it tasted good. It just was pretty expensive for what we got.", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Mixed"}
            5. If review is: "The hamburgers we ordered took a very long time and when they arrived they were just OK.", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Negative"}
            6. If review is: "This food delivery experience was super bad. Overpriced, super slow, and the food was not that great. Disappointed.", then the output should only be {"Classification": "Very Negative"}
            7. If review is: "An experience like none other", then the output should be "{"Classification": Other"}
        
         It is very important that you do not return anything but the JSON formatted response. 
            
        <review>', review, '</review>
        JSON formatted Classification Response: '
                )
    ) as sentiment_assessment   
    , snowflake.cortex.complete(
        'mixtral-8x7b'
        , concat('You are a helpful data assistant. Your job is to classify customer input <review>. If you are unsure, return null. For a given category classify the sentiment for that category as: Very Positive, Positive, Mixed, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative. Respond exclusively in JSON format.

        {
        food_cost:
        food_quality:
        food_delivery_time:
    
        }
      '  
, review 
, 'Return results'
        )) as sentiment_categories
FROM 
    ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS;
```

  If you look inside of `ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT_TEST` you'll notice two new columns: `sentiment_assesment` and `sentiment_categories`. `sentiment_assesment` contains overall assessment of the sentiment based on the review and `sentiment_categories` has an evaluation of each of three components individually: cost, quality and delivery time.

  <img src ='assets/geo_ml_11.png'>

  Now when you see that the results stick to the expected format, you can run the query above without the `top 10` limit. This query might take some time to complete, so to save time for this quickstart we've ran it for you in advance and stored results which you can import into new table by running following two queries:


```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT (
	ORDER_ID NUMBER(38,0),
	CUSTOMER_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	DELIVERY_LOCATION GEOGRAPHY,
	DELIVERY_POSTCODE NUMBER(38,0),
	DELIVERY_DISTANCE_MILES FLOAT,
	RESTAURANT_FOOD_TYPE VARCHAR(16777216),
	RESTAURANT_LOCATION GEOGRAPHY,
	RESTAURANT_POSTCODE NUMBER(38,0),
	RESTAURANT_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	REVIEW VARCHAR(16777216),
	SENTIMENT_ASSESSMENT VARCHAR(16777216),
	SENTIMENT_CATEGORIES VARCHAR(16777216)
);

COPY INTO ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT
FROM @ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.AA_STAGE/food_delivery_reviews.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = csv_format_nocompression);
```

### Step 3. Data transformation

Now when you have a table with sentiment, you need to parse JSONs to store each component of the score into a separate column and convert the scoring provided by the LLM into numeric format, so you can easily visualize it. Run the following query:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT_analysis AS
SELECT * exclude (food_cost, food_quality, food_delivery_time, sentiment) ,
         CASE
             WHEN sentiment = 'very positive' THEN 5
             WHEN sentiment = 'positive' THEN 4
             WHEN sentiment = 'neutral'
                  OR sentiment = 'mixed' THEN 3
             WHEN sentiment = 'negative' THEN 2
             WHEN sentiment = 'very negative' THEN 1
             ELSE NULL
         END sentiment_score ,
         CASE
             WHEN food_cost = 'very positive' THEN 5
             WHEN food_cost = 'positive' THEN 4
             WHEN food_cost = 'neutral'
                  OR food_cost = 'mixed' THEN 3
             WHEN food_cost = 'negative' THEN 2
             WHEN food_cost = 'very negative' THEN 1
             ELSE NULL
         END cost_score ,
         CASE
             WHEN food_quality = 'very positive' THEN 5
             WHEN food_quality = 'positive' THEN 4
             WHEN food_quality = 'neutral'
                  OR food_quality = 'mixed' THEN 3
             WHEN food_quality = 'negative' THEN 2
             WHEN food_quality = 'very negative' THEN 1
             ELSE NULL
         END food_quality_score ,
         CASE
             WHEN food_delivery_time = 'very positive' THEN 5
             WHEN food_delivery_time = 'positive' THEN 4
             WHEN food_delivery_time = 'neutral'
                  OR food_delivery_time = 'mixed' THEN 3
             WHEN food_delivery_time = 'negative' THEN 2
             WHEN food_delivery_time = 'very negative' THEN 1
             ELSE NULL
         END delivery_time_score
FROM
  (SELECT order_id ,
          customer_id ,
          delivery_location ,
          delivery_postcode ,
          delivery_distance_miles ,
          restaurant_food_type ,
          restaurant_location ,
          restaurant_postcode ,
          restaurant_id ,
          review ,
          try_parse_json(lower(sentiment_assessment)):classification::varchar AS sentiment ,
          try_parse_json(lower(sentiment_categories)):food_cost::varchar AS food_cost ,
          try_parse_json(lower(sentiment_categories)):food_quality::varchar AS food_quality ,
          try_parse_json(lower(sentiment_categories)):food_delivery_time::varchar AS food_delivery_time
   FROM ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.ORDERS_REVIEWS_SENTIMENT);
```

### Step 4. Data visualization

In this step, you will visualize the scoring results on the map. Open `Projects > Streamlit > + Streamlit App`. Give the new app a name, for example `Sentiment analysis - results`, and pick `ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC` as an app location.

You can start with the overall analysis of the order density. When you select "DELIVERY_LOCATION" as a Dimension and "ORDERS" as a Measure you'll see what areas correspond to the high number of orders. You can use scale 7 and zoom in to identify clear clusters of where the most deliveries are occurring. In this case you see most deliveries are in Santa Clara, San Jose, and the San Francisco Bay. In particular, the area on the San Francisco peninsula looks to be an area of interest. Zooming in further you can see a dense area of delivery orders.

Using a finer H3 resolution, 8 shows how the delivery densities are distributed more finely. From this resolution, you can see the orders are concentrated in Daly City and proceed down to San Bruno. Additionally, in the North, the majority of the orders are coming from the stretch of the Sunset District to the Mission District.

Now that you know where the majority of orders are coming from, let's analyze whether there are interesting differences in customer satisfaction depending on where they are located. Select DELIVERY LOCATION as a dimension and SENTIMENT_SCORE as a Measure to see the overall sentiment score that the Cortex LLM Complete Function generated. You can notice that the customers are mostly satisfied in the areas of Daly City down to San Jose, in the Santa Rosa area, and around Dublin. You also see that the area between these is mostly showing unhappy customers.

In order to understand why customers in this area are unhappy, you analyze the aspect based sentiment results of the Cortex LLM Complete Function generated  for the categories of interest: food cost, delivery time, and the food quality. If you focus purely on the customers that were unhappy, you see that the primary reasons are food quality and food cost getting poor scores. Essentially, the food is not worth the cost and delivery time being fast does not make up for this. Check visualizations using the following combinations of parameters:

If you look at all H3 cells where food quality was high, the average sentiment score is also generally high. Again, you can see there are no cells where customers felt the food quality was above average in the greater Berkeley area. This could indicate either that high quality delivery food is uncommon or that the customers in these areas have higher expectations for delivery food.

You can also analyze what areas are getting higher scores for each of the categories and how it correlates with the overall sentiment scores for restaurants in each area.
