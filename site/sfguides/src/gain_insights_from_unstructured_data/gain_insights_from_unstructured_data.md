# Gain Insights From Unstructured Data using Snowflake Cortex
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

In this Quickstart guide, you will be help the fictitious food truck company, Tasty Bytes, to identify where their customer experience may be falling short at the truck and business level by leveraging **Snowflake Cortex**. The company gathers customer reviews across multiple sources and languages to assess their food truck operations. This comprehensive feedback helps them identify areas for improvement, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Leveraging Snowflake Cortex's advanced language AI capabilities, they can automatically process reviews through real-time translation, generate actionable insights through intelligent summarization, and analyze customer sentiment at scale – transforming diverse, unstructured feedback into strategic business decisions that drive their food truck operations forward.

## Translate
Duration: 2

### Overview

You will leverage **Translate** - one of the **Snowflake Cortex specialized LLM functions** are available in Snowpark ML:
  * Translate the multilingual reviews to english to enable easier analysis.

### Hear what your international customers are saying
This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `CORTEX_TRANSLATE`.

#### Python
  ```python
  # Conditionally translate reviews that are not english using Cortex Translate
  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('TRANSLATED_REVIEW',when(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en"), \
                                                              cortex.translate(F.col('REVIEW'), \
                                                                              F.col('LANGUAGE'), \

                                    .otherwise(F.col('REVIEW')))

  reviews_df.filter(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en")).select(["REVIEW","LANGUAGE","TRANSLATED_REVIEW"]).show(3)
  ```
#### SQL
 ```sql
  -- Add the TRANSLATED_REVIEW column with conditional translation
  WITH TRANSLATED_REVIEWS AS (
      SELECT 
          REVIEW,
          LANGUAGE,
          CASE 
              WHEN LANGUAGE != 'en' THEN SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(REVIEW, LANGUAGE, 'en') 
              ELSE REVIEW
          END AS TRANSLATED_REVIEW
      FROM TRUCK_REVIEWS_V

  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('RECOMMEND', ai_classify(prompt("Tell me based on the following food truck customer review {0}, will they recommend the food truck to their friends and family?", F.col('REVIEW')),["Likely","Unlikely","Unsure"])["labels"][0])

  reviews_df.select(["REVIEW","CLEAN_RECOMMEND"]).show(3)
  ```
#### SQL
  ```sql
  WITH CLASSIFIED_REVIEWS AS (
      SELECT 
          REVIEW,
          AI_CLASSIFY(
              REVIEW, 
              ['Likely', 'Unlikely', 'Unsure'], 
              OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('task_description', 
                  'Tell me based on the following food truck customer review, will they recommend the food truck to their friends and family?'
              )
          ):labels[0]::TEXT AS RECOMMEND
