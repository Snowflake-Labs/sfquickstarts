Duration: 2

### Enabled by Cortex Translate

You will leverage **Translate** - one of the **Snowflake Cortex specialised LLM functions** are available in Snowpark ML, to translate the multilingual reviews to english to enable easier analysis. This is done within the notebook using following code snippet in cell `CORTEX_TRANSLATE`.

  ```python
  # Conditionally translate reviews that are not english using Cortex Translate
  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('TRANSLATED_REVIEW',when(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en"), \
                                                              cortex.Translate(F.col('REVIEW'), \
                                                                              F.col('LANGUAGE'), \
                                                                              "en")) \
                                    .otherwise(F.col('REVIEW')))

  reviews_df.filter(F.col('LANGUAGE') != F.lit("en")).select(["REVIEW","LANGUAGE","TRANSLATED_REVIEW"]).show(3)
  ```

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Summarize what the customers are saying
Duration: 5

### Overview

In this section, you will leverage **Snowflake Cortex - Summarize** to quickly understand what the customers are saying:

### We want to get a insight on what people are saying

* In this step, we will get a summarization of customers are saying **Snowflake Cortex - Summarize** 

  ```python
  # Step 1: Add a row number for each review within each TRUCK_BRAND_NAME
  window_spec = Window.partition_by("TRUCK_BRAND_NAME").order_by("REVIEW")
  ranked_reviews_df = reviews_df.with_column(
      "ROW_NUM", F.row_number().over(window_spec)
  )

  # Step 2: Filter to include only the first 20 rows per TRUCK_BRAND_NAME to get a general idea
  filtered_reviews_df = ranked_reviews_df.filter(F.col("ROW_NUM") <= 20)

  # Step 3: Aggregate reviews by TRUCK_BRAND_NAME
  aggregated_reviews_df = filtered_reviews_df.group_by("TRUCK_BRAND_NAME").agg(
      F.array_agg(F.col("REVIEW")).alias("ALL_REVIEWS")
  )

  # Step 4: Convert the array of reviews to a single string
  concatenated_reviews_df = aggregated_reviews_df.with_column(
      "ALL_REVIEWS_TEXT", F.call_function("array_to_string", F.col("ALL_REVIEWS"), F.lit(' '))
  )

  # Step 5: Generate summaries for each truck brand
  summarized_reviews_df = concatenated_reviews_df.with_column(
      "SUMMARY", cortex.Summarize(F.col("ALL_REVIEWS_TEXT"))
  )

  # Step 6: Display the results
  summarized_reviews_df.select(["TRUCK_BRAND_NAME", "SUMMARY"]).show(3)

  one_summary_row = summarized_reviews_df.limit(1).collect()
  if one_summary_row:
      brand = one_summary_row[0]['TRUCK_BRAND_NAME']
      summary = one_summary_row[0]['SUMMARY']

      # Split the summary roughly in half
      half = len(summary) // 2
      split_index = summary[:half].rfind(' ')  # Find the last space before the halfway point
      if split_index == -1:
          split_index = half  # If no space found, split at halfway

      summary_part1 = summary[:split_index].strip()
      summary_part2 = summary[split_index:].strip()

      print(f"Truck Brand: {brand}")
      print(f"Summary (part 1): {summary_part1}")
      print(f"Summary (part 2): {summary_part2}")
  ```
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Categorise unstructured review text data 
Duration: 5

### Overview
In this section, you will make use of **Snowflake Cortex - ClassifyText** to categorise reviews to understand:
  * How good their overall experience was
  * How likely their customers are to recommend Tasty Bytes food trucks to someone they know 

### Get intention to recommend based on review with Cortex ClassifyText

* You can understand if a customer would recommend the food truck based on their review using **Snowflake Cortex - ClassifyText**. 

  ```python
  # Prompt to understand whether a customer would recommend food truck based on their review 
  text_description = """
  Tell me based on the following food truck customer review, will they recommend the food truck to \
  their friends and family? Answer should be only one of the following words - \
  "Likely" or "Unlikely" or "Unsure".
  """

  reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('RECOMMEND', cortex.ClassifyText(F.col('REVIEW'),["Likely","Unlikely","Unsure"], test_description))\
  .withColumn('CLEAN_RECOMMEND', when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Likely')), \
                                                              F.lit('Likely')) \
                                        .when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Unlikely' )), \
                                                              F.lit('Unlikely')) \
              .when(F.contains(F.col('RECOMMEND'), F.lit('Unsure' )), \
                                                              F.lit('Unsure')))

  reviews_df.select(["REVIEW","CLEAN_RECOMMEND"]).show(3)
  ```
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Extract Answers from what your customers are saying
Duration: 5

### Overview

In this section, you will leverage **Snowflake Cortex - Extract Answer** to get answers to your questrions:

### Answer specifc quesions you have 

* Using **Snowflake Cortex - Extract Answer** to dive into quesitons you have

  ```python
  # Step 1: Add a row number for each review within each TRUCK_BRAND_NAME
  window_spec = Window.partition_by("TRUCK_BRAND_NAME").order_by("REVIEW")
  ranked_reviews_df = reviews_df.with_column(
      "ROW_NUM", F.row_number().over(window_spec)
  )

  # Step 2: Filter to include only the first 20 rows per TRUCK_BRAND_NAME to get a general idea
  filtered_reviews_df = ranked_reviews_df.filter(F.col("ROW_NUM") <= 20)

  # Step 3: Aggregate reviews by TRUCK_BRAND_NAME
  aggregated_reviews_df = filtered_reviews_df.group_by("TRUCK_BRAND_NAME").agg(
      F.array_agg(F.col("REVIEW")).alias("ALL_REVIEWS")
  )

  # Step 4: Convert the array of reviews to a single string
  concatenated_reviews_df = aggregated_reviews_df.with_column(
      "ALL_REVIEWS_TEXT", F.call_function("array_to_string", F.col("ALL_REVIEWS"), F.lit(' '))
  )

  # Step 5: Generate summaries for each truck brand
  summarized_reviews_df = concatenated_reviews_df.with_column(
      "NUMBER_ONE_DISH", cortex.ExtractAnswer(F.col("ALL_REVIEWS_TEXT"), "What is the number one dish positivly mentioned in the feedback?")
  )

  # Step 6: Extract the first element of the array
  first_element_df = summarized_reviews_df.with_column(
      "FIRST_ELEMENT", F.expr("NUMBER_ONE_DISH[0]")
  )

  # Step 7: Parse the first element as JSON and extract the "answer" field
  readable_df = first_element_df.with_column(
      "NUMBER_ONE_DISH", F.get(F.parse_json(F.col("FIRST_ELEMENT")), F.lit("answer"))
  )

  # Display the simplified results
  readable_df.select(["TRUCK_BRAND_NAME", "NUMBER_ONE_DISH"]).show()
  ```
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Understand customer sentiment 
Duration: 2

### Enabled by Cortex Sentiment

So far you saw Snowflake Cortex - Translate & Complete. Next, you will look at another **task specific LLM function in Cortex - Sentiment**. This sentiment function is used to understand the customer's tone  based on the review they provided. Sentiment return value between -1 and 1 such that -1 is the most negative while 1 is the most positive. This is done within the notebook using the following code snippet in cell `CORTEX_SENTIMENT`.

```python
# Understand the sentiment of customer review using Cortex Sentiment
reviews_df = reviews_df.withColumn('SENTIMENT', cortex.Sentiment(F.col('REVIEW')))

reviews_df.select(["REVIEW","SENTIMENT"]).show(3)
```
