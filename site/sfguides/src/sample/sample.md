# Snowflake Guide Template
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

Please use [this markdown file](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts/blob/master/site/sfguides/src/_template/markdown.template) as a template for writing your own Snowflake Quickstarts. This example guide has elements that you will use when writing your own quickstarts, including: code snippet highlighting, downloading files, inserting photos, and more. 

It is important to include on the first page of your guide the following sections: Prerequisites, What you'll learn, What you'll need, and What you'll build. Remember, part of the purpose of a Snowflake Guide is that the reader will have **built** something by the end of the tutorial; this means that actual code needs to be included (not just pseudo-code or concepts).

The rest of this Snowflake Guide explains the steps of writing your own guide. 

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to set the metadata for a guide (category, author, id, etc)
- how to set the amount of time each slide will take to finish 
- how to include code snippets 
- how to hyperlink items 
- how to include images 

### What You’ll Need 
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Installed
- [GoLang](https://golang.org/doc/install) Installed

### What You’ll Build 
- A Snowflake Guide

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Metadata Configuration
Duration: 2

It is important to set the correct metadata for your Snowflake Guide. The metadata contains all the information required for listing and publishing your guide and includes the following:


- **summary**: This is a sample Snowflake Guide 
  - This should be a short, 1 sentence description of your guide. This will be visible on the main landing page. 
- **id**: sample 
  - make sure to match the id here with the name of the file, all one word.
- **categories**: data-science 
  - You can have multiple categories, but the first one listed is used for the icon.
- **environments**: web 
  - `web` is default. If this will be published for a specific event or  conference, include it here.
- **status**: Published
  - (`Draft`, `Published`, `Deprecated`, `Hidden`) to indicate the progress and whether the sfguide is ready to be published. `Hidden` implies the sfguide is for restricted use, should be available only by direct URL, and should not appear on the main landing page.
- **feedback link**: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguides/issues
- **tags**: Getting Started, Data Science, Twitter 
  - Add relevant  tags to make your sfguide easily found and SEO friendly.
- **authors**: Daniel Myers 
  - Indicate the author(s) of this specific sfguide.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Creating a Step
Duration: 2

A single sfguide consists of multiple steps. These steps are defined in Markdown using Header 2 tag `##`. 

```markdown
## Step 1 Title
Duration: 3

All the content for the step goes here.

## Step 2 Title
Duration: 1

All the content for the step goes here.
```

To indicate how long each step will take, set the `Duration` under the step title (i.e. `##`) to an integer. The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular step will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total sfguide completion time is calculated automatically for you and will be displayed on the landing page.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
Duration: 1

The Conclusion and Next Steps section is one of the most important parts of a guide. This last section helps to sum up all the information the reader has gone through, and in many ways should read like a [TLDR summary](https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/#post-435266:~:text=How%20Do%20You%20Use%20TLDR%3F,you%E2%80%99re%20the%20author%20or%20commenter.%20Using). 

There are three main sub-headers in a Conclusion step:

1. a general conclusion paragraph (what you are reading now!)
2. "What We've Covered" section with a bulleted list of things
3. "Related Resources" with links to various other resources, other guides, docs, videos, GitHub source code, etc.

It's also important to remember that by the time a reader has completed a Guide, the goal is that they have actually built something! Guides teach through hands-on examples -- not just explaining concepts.

### What We've Covered
- creating steps and setting duration
- adding code snippets
- embedding images, videos, and surveys
- importing other markdown files
