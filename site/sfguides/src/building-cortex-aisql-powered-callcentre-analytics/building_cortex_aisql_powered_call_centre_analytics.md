## Setup

Duration: 5

### 1. Environment Setup 

To set up your Snowflake environment for the call centre analytics solution perform the following steps:

1. Open the [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/setup.sql) file from the git repo or from the cloned local folder.
1. Open a new sql worksheet in Snowsight.
1. Paste the contents of [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/setup.sql) file or upload and run the file.

The script will create:

- A new database for the solution.
- Stages for Audio Files and Semantic Model.
- Copies the audio files and semantic model yaml file from github to the stage by creating API Integration and Git repo in Snowflake.

### 2. File to Upload to Stage

 Ensure the uploaded files has the following folder structure in the stage.

 ![Audio File Listing](assets/audio_file_stage_screenshot.png)

 If you are unable to create the API integration and GIT repository in Snowflake you should upload the following files to the stages created.
 
 - All the files in <b>*[`audio_files`](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/tree/main/audio_files)*</b> folder from your cloned repo to *AUDIO_FILES* stage that you have created above. 

 - Upload ['call_center_analytics_model.yaml'](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/call_center_analytics_model.yaml) to *SEMANTIC_MODEL_STAGE* stage.

Following two files are for: 
- `streamlit_cortex_analyst_dashboard_sis.py` - Main Streamlit application

- `call_center_analytics_model.yaml` - Semantic model for Cortex Analyst


## Audio Transcription and Analysis

Upload the ['Call-Centre-Analytics-Notebook.ipynb'](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/Call-Centre-Analytics-Notebook.ipynb) notebook from Snowsight.

Navigate to Projects → Notebooks and then click ⌄ to Import ipynb file and select the file Call-Centre-Analytics-Notebook.ipynb.
Make sure to choose the notebook location to match **call_centre_analytics_db** Database and the **public** Schema, and choose the warehouse we created earlier **cca_xs_wh** for the query warehouse and the notebook warehouse.

Run through the notebook which does following:

- Transcribe all the audio files using Cortex AI_TRANSCRIBE  .
- Add prompts for extracting various information from the transcribed text.
- Populate table(s) required for Cortex Analyst and dashboard reports.

## Streamlit Application 

After you complete running through the notebook you can create the streamlit app by navigate to Projects → Streamlit and create a new Streamlit application by selecting the below options:

1. **App Title**: CALL_CENTRE_ANALYTICS_APP
2. **Database**: Choose `CALL_CENTRE_ANALYTICS_DB`
3. **Schema**: Choose `PUBLIC`
4. **Warehouse**: Choose `cca_xs_wh` warehouse

Paste the contents of [streamlit_cortex_analyst_dashboard_sis.py](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/streamlit_cortex_analyst_dashboard_sis.py) and run the streamlit app. 

While running the app for the first time it will give you package not found error for plotly, please add ploytly in the call_centre_analytics_app streamlit app packages and rerun the app  .

### 2. Cortex Analyst Integration

The heart of the application leverages Snowflake's Cortex Analyst for natural language querying on the audio files. We can have a conversation chatbot where it sends the history for asking question based on previous question.

**Chat Interface Implementation**
```python
def query_cortex_analyst_rest_api(question: str, conversation_history: List[Dict] = None) -> Dict[Any, Any]:
    """Query Cortex Analyst with conversation context"""
    
    request_body = {
        "question": question,
        "semantic_model": semantic_model_content,
        "conversation": conversation_history or []
    }
    
    response = session.post(CORTEX_ANALYST_ENDPOINT, json=request_body)
    return response.json()
```
Question asked `How mant calls were not resolved on the first attempt` and below is the response:
![Analysts First Question](assets/analyst_question1.png)

Now I am asking a followup question:
`give me the list of reps and the audio info along with date for the above data` and below is the output
![Analysts Followup Question](assets/analyst_question2.png)

You can see from the screenshot that it is giving us the details for the rep name and the audio file for all the conversation which is not a first call resolution. Following is the query generated by the Cortex Analyst where it filters for first_call_resolution = 'No' showing how powerful cortex analyst is.

```sql
WITH __call_center_interactions AS (
  SELECT
    audio_file_name,
    representative AS representative_name,
    firstcallresolution AS first_call_resolution,
    datetime AS call_date
  FROM call_centre_analytics_db.public.streamlitapptable
)
SELECT
  representative_name,
  audio_file_name,
  call_date
FROM __call_center_interactions
WHERE
  first_call_resolution = 'No'
ORDER BY
  call_date DESC NULLS LAST
 -- Generated by Cortex Analyst
;
```
**Features:**
- Persistent conversation history
- Context-aware responses
- Export conversation logs

#### 3. On-Demand Audio File Transcribing and Processing

The application provides comprehensive audio file handling capabilities. You can upload the file from your local machine and ask the app to process the audio file.

**Key Features:**

1. **Upload Audio Files**: Drag and drop or browse for audio files
2. **Processing Status**: Monitor upload progress and processing status  
3. **File Management**: View uploaded files and their processing status
4. **Playback**: Listen to processed audio files directly in the interface

![Audio Upload Interface Screenshot](assets/audiofile_upload_ui.png)

You can use the file [ztest_9.mp3](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-building-cortex-aisql-powered-callcentre-analytics/blob/main/ztest_9.mp3) to test the uploading and processing adhoc audio file from the streamlit app.
