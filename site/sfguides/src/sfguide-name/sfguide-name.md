# Snowflake Guide Template
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

hello

The rest of this Snowflake Guide explains the steps of writing your own guide. 

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to set the metadata for a guide (category, author, id, etc)
- how to set the amount of time each slide will take to finish 
- how to include code snippets 
- how to hyperlink items 
- how to include images 

### What You’ll Need 
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Installed
- [GoLang](https://golang.org/doc/install) Installed

### What You’ll Build 
- A Snowflake Guide

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Metadata Configuration

It is important to set the correct metadata for your Snowflake Guide. The metadata contains all the information required for listing and publishing your guide and includes the following:


- **summary**: This is a sample Snowflake Guide 
  - This should be a short, 1 sentence description of your guide. This will be visible on the main landing page. 
- **id**: sample 
  - make sure to match the id here with the name of the file, all one word.
- **categories**: data-science 
  - You can have multiple categories, but the first one listed is used for the icon.
- **environments**: web 
  - `web` is default. If this will be published for a specific event or  conference, include it here.
- **status**: Published
  - (`Draft`, `Published`, `Deprecated`, `Hidden`) to indicate the progress and whether the sfguide is ready to be published. `Hidden` implies the sfguide is for restricted use, should be available only by direct URL, and should not appear on the main landing page.
- **feedback link**: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguides/issues
- **tags**: Getting Started, Data Science, Twitter 
  - Add relevant  tags to make your sfguide easily found and SEO friendly.
- **authors**: Daniel Myers 
  - Indicate the author(s) of this specific sfguide.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Creating a Step

A single sfguide consists of multiple steps. These steps are defined in Markdown using Header 2 tag `##`. 

```markdown
## Step 1 Title

All the content for the step goes here.

## Step 2 Title

All the content for the step goes here.
```


The total sfguide completion time is calculated automatically for you and will be displayed on the landing page.
