# **Distributed Multi-Node and Multi GPU Audio Transcription with Snowflake ML Container Runtime**
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Duration: 10

In this Quickstart guide, we will walk through how to use [Container Runtime](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/container-runtime-ml) in [Snowflake ML](http://www.snowflake.com/ml) to perform Multi-Node, Multi-GPU audio transcription at limitless scale over multiple audio files.

### What is Snowflake ML?

[Snowflake ML](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/) is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning in a single platform on top of your governed data. Data scientists and ML engineers can easily and securely develop and productionize scalable features and models without any data movement, silos or governance tradeoffs.

### What is Container Runtime?

[Container Runtime](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/container-runtime-ml) gives you a flexible container infrastructure that supports building and operationalizing a wide variety of resource-intensive ML workflows entirely within Snowflake. 

Container Runtime is a set of preconfigured customizable environments built for machine learning on Snowpark Container Services, covering interactive experimentation and batch ML workloads such as model training, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference and fine tuning. They include the most popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks. Container Runtime also provides flexibility the ability to pip install any open-source package of choice.

### What is Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime?

[Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs)  are a powerful IDE option for building ML models at scale in [Snowflake ML](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/). 

Snowflake Notebooks are natively built into Snowsight, and provide everything you need for interactive development, cell by cell execution of Python, Markdown and SQL code. By using Snowflake Notebooks one can increase the productivity since it simplifies connecting to the data and using popular OSS libraries for ML use cases. Notebooks on Container Runtime offer a robust environment with a comprehensive repository of pre-installed CPU and GPU machine learning packages and frameworks, significantly reducing the need for package management and dependency troubleshooting. This allows you to quickly get started with your preferred frameworks and even import models from external sources. Additionally, you can use pip to install any custom package as needed. The runtime also features an optimized data ingestion layer and provides a set of powerful APIs for training and hyperparameter tuning. These APIs extend popular ML packages, enabling you to train models efficiently within Snowflake. At the core of this solution is a Ray-powered distributed compute cluster, giving you seamless access to both CPU and GPU resources. This ensures high performance and optimal infrastructure usage without the need for complex setup or configuration, allowing you to focus solely on your machine learning workloads.

Key Features:

* Managed Environment: Focus on your ML projects without the overhead of managing underlying infrastructure.  
* Scalability: Leverage distributed computing resources to efficiently handle large datasets and complex computations.  
* Integration: Seamlessly combine with Snowflake's ML operations for a cohesive workflow.

### What is Container Runtime’s architecture?

![ContainerRuntime Architecture](assets/container_runtime_architecture.png)

### What APIs does Container Runtime have to support Unstructured Data Processing?

Container Runtime for ML provides several APIs to handle unstructured data, such as images, text and binary files, from Snowflake Stage and process it in Snowflake's Container Runtime using [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html). These APIs enable efficient unstructured data processing and analysis without the need for complex data movement or transformation. At the time of writing this quickstart, Container Runtime for ML has the following APIs for handling unstructured data:

1. Reading into Snowflake:   
   1. SFStageImageDatasource \- This class allows us to load images from Snowflake Stage and pass them forward for distributed processing with Container Runtime for ML.  
   2. SFStageTextDatasource \- This class allows us to load text from Snowflake Stage and use them in downstream distributed calls.  
   3. SFStageBinaryFileDataSource \- This class allows us to read content from Snowflake stage as binary files and use them in downstream processors.  
2. Writing to Snowflake:   
   1. SnowflakeTableDatasink \- This class provides snowflake specific [Ray data sink APIs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/doc/ray.data.Datasink.html) to allow customers write the processed dataset into a snowflake table

In this quickstart, we will be using SFStageBinaryFileDataSource and SnowflakeTableDatasink class.

### What model are we using for audio transcription?

Whisper is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation, proposed in the paper [Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision](https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.04356) by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. Trained on \>5M hours of labeled data, Whisper demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains in a zero-shot setting.

Whisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous [large](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large) and [large-v2](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2) models, except for the following minor differences:

1. The spectrogram input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80  
2. A new language token for Cantonese

See details here for the [model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3)

## Audio Transcription
<!-- ------------------------ -->
Duration: 10

This Notebook linked below demonstrates the distributed inferencing of audio files on Snowflake ML Container Runtime using multiple nodes and multiple GPUs.

In this notebook, we will be using SFStageBinaryFileDataSource and SnowflakeTableDatasink class. The signature of these two classes are as below:

```py
class SFStageBinaryFileDataSource(
    stage_location: str,
    database: Optional[str] = None,
    schema: Optional[str] = None,
    file_pattern: Optional[str] = None,
    local_path: Optional[str] = None,
)
```

* stage\_location:. Stage path  
* database: Database name. Defaults to notebook session's current database   
* schema: Schema name. Defaults to notebook session's current database   
* file\_pattern: The file pattern to filter the files in the stage. It supports Unix shell-style wildcards. Example: "\*.flac" will match all files with .png extension Default is to include all files under stage\_location  
* local\_path: The local path to save the files if you choose to. Defaults to None. None means the file will not be saved to the local disk and the consumption will be through the content file\_binary. Note, in a multi-node cluster, this is not recommended, since files will be only available in the main node. 

```py
from snowflake.ml.ray.datasink import SnowflakeTableDatasink

datasink = SnowflakeTableDatasink(
    table_name="MY_TABLE",
    database = "MY_DB",
    schema = "MY_SCHEMA",
    auto_create_table=True,
    override=True,
)

# Write a processed dataset back to a snowflake table
# For example take the Text API processing example above
label_dataset.write_datasink(datasink, concurrency=4)
# Now you can query the table in `MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE'
```
