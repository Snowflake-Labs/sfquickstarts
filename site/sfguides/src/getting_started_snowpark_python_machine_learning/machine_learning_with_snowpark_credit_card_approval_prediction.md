# Machine Learning with Snowpark Python: - Credit Card Approval Prediction
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 5

### What is Snowpark?

The set of libraries and runtimes in Snowflake that securely deploy and process non-SQL code, including Python, Java and Scala.

**Familiar Client Side Libraries** - Snowpark brings deeply integrated, DataFrame-style programming and OSS compatible APIs to the languages data practitioners like to use. It also includes the Snowpark ML API for more efficient ML modeling (public preview) and ML operations (private preview).

**Flexible Runtime Constructs** - Snowpark provides flexible runtime constructs that allow users to bring in and run custom logic. Developers can seamlessly build data pipelines, ML models, and data applications with User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures.

### What is Snowpark ML?

Snowpark ML is a new library for faster and more intuitive end-to-end ML development in Snowflake. Snowpark ML has 2 APIs: Snowpark ML Modeling (in Public Preview) for model development and Snowpark ML Operations (in Private Preview) for model deployment.

This quickstart will focus on the Snowpark ML Modeling API, which scales out feature engineering and simplifies ML training execution in Snowflake.

The source code for this quickstart is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-machine-learning).

### Prerequisites
- Working knowledge of [Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-python-and-pandas/)
- Familiarity with [Snowflake](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowflake/index.html#0)

### What You’ll Learn 
- Loading and transforming data via Snowpark
- Apply scalable data transformations with Snowpark ML
- Train, score and evaluate models with Snowpark ML
- Hyperparameter Tuning with Snowpark ML

### What You’ll Need 
- A free [Snowflake Trial Account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_cta=quickstarts_) 
- [Anaconda Integration enabled by ORGADMIN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-packages.html#using-third-party-packages-from-anaconda)
- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook

### What You’ll Build 
You will build an end-to-end data science workflow
- to load, clean and prepare data
- to train different machine learning models
- to tune hyper parameters

The end-to-end workflow will look like this:

## Use-Case: Credit Card Approval Prediction
Duration: 3

You are part of a team of data engineers and data scientists at a banking company that has been tasked to identify high-risk customers using a machine learning based solution. The goal is to give a recommendation to either approve or reject the issueing of a credit card.

To build this, you have access to customer demographic and credit history data. Using Snowpark, we will ingest, analyze and transform this data to train a model that will then be deployed inside Snowflake to score new data.

The dataset you are using is part of a Kaggle competition that can be found here:  
[Kaggle: Credit Card Approval Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Python Environment Setup 
Duration: 5

Let's set up the Python environment necessary to run this quickstart:

First, clone the source code for this repo to your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-machine-learning.git
cd sfguide-getting-started-machine-learning/
```

### Snowpark Python via Anaconda
If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) on your local machine, create a conda env for this quickstart:
```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
conda activate pysnowpark
```

Conda will automatically install `snowflake-snowpark-python` and all other dependencies for you.

Now, launch Jupyter Notebook on your local machine:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Snowpark with your own Environment
If you decide to bring your own Python environment, please make sure to install all of the required packages from the conda_env.yml

## Snowflake Environment Setup
Duration: 5

**What You'll Do**: 
- Establish the Snowpark Python session
- Create the database, schema, and warehouses needed for the remainder of the lab
- Load raw csv data into Snowflake

First of all, locate the following information:
- Username
- Password
- [Organization- and Accountname](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations-gs.html#viewing-the-name-of-your-organization-and-its-accounts)

You'll need these values to connect to your Snowflake Account via Snowpark.

After that, open up the [`0_setup_environment`](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-machine-learning/blob/main/hol/0_setup_environment.ipynb) Jupyter notebook and run each of the cells to setup your Snowflake Account and load the required datasets into Snowflake.
