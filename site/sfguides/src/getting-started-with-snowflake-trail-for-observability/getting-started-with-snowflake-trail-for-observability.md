# Getting Started with Snowflake Trail for Observability
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 3

Snowflake Trail is Snowflake's suite of observability capabilities that enable its users to better monitor, troubleshoot, debug and take actions on pipelines, apps, user code and compute utilizations.

![Snowflake Trail Infographic](./assets/snowflake-trail-25-new.svg)

As you can see above, Snowflake Trail utilizes core observability data — logs, metrics, traces, events, alerts, and notifications — to provide comprehensive workload monitoring across AI, applications, pipelines, and infrastructure.

This quickstart is intended to help tie together all the components of Snowflake Trail, and in turn, help you get started with Observability in Snowflake. While this quickstart will walk you through the basics of enabling and viewing telemetry, you will need to dive deeper into each area in order to fully understand Snowflake Trail. So wherever possible, links will be provided to additional quickstarts, documentation, and resources.

- Foundation for implementing comprehensive observability across your Snowflake workloads

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Data Source Overview

Duration: 2

Observability in Snowflake comes in two main categories: System Views and Telemetry.

**System Views** provide historical data about your Snowflake account through views and table functions in the following schemas:

   1. The [Snowflake Information Schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/info-schema) (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`) in every Snowflake database
   1. The [Account Usage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (`ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `READER_ACCOUNT_USAGE`) in the Snowflake database
   1. The [Organization Usage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (`ORGANIZATION_USAGE`) in the Snowflake database

**Telemetry data**, on the other hand, is delivered exclusively through [event tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up). An event table is a special kind of database table with a [predefined set of columns](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-columns) that follows the data model for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) - a leading the industry standard for collecting and structuring observability data across systems.

This distinction is important because of the default behavior of each:

- System Views are always available and automatically populated with data about your Snowflake usage
- Telemetry data requires you to **explicitly enable collection** by setting levels for logging, metrics, and tracing

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Enabling Telemetry

Duration: 5

By default, Snowflake includes a [predefined event table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up#label-logging-event-table-default) (`SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS`) that is used if you don't specify an active event table. You can also [create your own event tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up#label-logging-event-table-custom) for specific uses.

Most telemetry levels can be set at the account, object, or session level. And while many of the telemetry levels can be set via Snowsight, some require using SQL commands for full flexibility.

For this quickstart, we will focus on enabling telemetry at the account level. We will show you both the SQL and Snowsight methods, and use the default table.

Complete **one** of the following:

### (Option 1): Setting Telemetry Levels via Snowsight

You can use Snowsight to set telemetry levels at the account level.

1. Sign in to Snowsight.
1. In the navigation menu, select **Monitoring** » **Traces and Logs**.
1. On the Traces & Logs page, select **Set Event Level**.
1. For **Set logging & tracing for**, ensure **Account** is selected.
1. Set your desired levels:
   1. For **All Events**, select **On**
   1. For **Logs**, select **INFO**
   1. Ensure all other fields show as **On**.
1. Click **Save**.

You can see the **Set Event Level** dialog box below.

![](./assets/set-event-level-light.png)

### (Option 2): Setting Telemetry Levels via SQL

1. Open a new SQL worksheet or a workspace.
1. Run the following:

```sql
-- Switch to ACCOUNTADMIN
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Set account level values
ALTER ACCOUNT SET LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'; 
ALTER ACCOUNT SET METRIC_LEVEL = 'ALL'; 
ALTER ACCOUNT SET TRACE_LEVEL = 'ALWAYS'; 

```

Note that valid and default values are as follows:

| Level          | Valid Values                                              | Default Value |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `LOG_LEVEL`    | `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `OFF` | `OFF`         |
| `METRIC_LEVEL` | `ALL`, `NONE`                                             | `NONE`        |
| `TRACE_LEVEL`  | `ALWAYS`, `ON_EVENT`, `OFF`                               | `OFF`         |

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Traces

Duration: 5

A **trace** represents the complete execution path of a request through your Snowflake workloads. It provides a detailed view of how operations flow through different components, helping you understand performance bottlenecks, dependencies, and execution patterns. Each trace is made up of one or more **spans**, where each span represents a single operation within the trace (like a SQL query, UDF execution, or procedure call).

### Why Traces Are Useful

Traces help you:

- Understand the end-to-end execution flow of complex operations
- Identify performance bottlenecks and slow operations
- Debug issues by seeing the exact sequence of operations
- Optimize query and procedure performance
- Monitor dependencies between different components

### Accessing Traces in Snowsight

The easiest way to get started with traces is through the Trace Explorer UI in Snowsight:

1. Navigate to **Monitoring** » **Traces and Logs**
1. (Optional) Use filters to narrow down the returned results.

You'll now have a list of all the traces for your event table. The Trace Explorer interface shows a list of traces with key information such as Date, Duration, Trace Name, Status, and number of Spans in the trace.

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing a list of traces](./assets/traces-list.png)

You can now click on any trace to view its spans in detail.

> aside positive
>
> If you don't see any traces after enabling tracing, you'll need to execute operations that generate traces, such as stored procedures or UDFs.
>
> Note that simple DML/DQL SQL commands executed directly in a worksheet or workspace **do not generate traces**. Traces are only generated when SQL is executed within supported handler code.
>
> For a complete walkthrough with examples, see: [Getting Started with Traces](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_traces/index.html).

### Viewing Trace Details

When you click on a trace, you'll see a detailed view showing the timeline of all spans within that trace. This view allows you to:

- **Filter by Span Type**: Use the **Span Type** drop-down to show or hide spans by type (_All_, _UDF_, _Procedures_, _Streamlit_, and/or _Query_).
- **Change the Legend**: Use the **Legend** drop-down to switch how spans are colored - either by _Type_ (operation type) or by _Query_ (Query ID).

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing the component spans.](./assets/trace-span.png)

### Viewing Span Details

Clicking on any individual span in the trace opens a sidebar with four tabs: **Details**, **Span Events**, **Related Metrics**, and **Logs**.

#### Details

The **Details** tab shows info and attributes about the selected span, including Trace ID, Span ID, Duration, Type, Warehouse, and more.

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing details about the span step](./assets/trace-details-details.png)

#### Span Events

The **Span Events** tab shows details of events recorded within the span.

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing details about span events](./assets/trace-details-span-events.png)

#### Related Metrics

The **Related Metrics** tab shows CPU and memory metrics related to the span.

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing details about related metrics](./assets/trace-details-metrics.png)

#### Logs

The **Logs** tab shows logs directly related to the trace.

![An screenshot of the Trace Explorer console showing details about related logs](./assets/trace-details-log.png)

This detailed information helps you understand exactly what happened during each operation and identify optimization opportunities.
