# Quickstart Guide: Cybersyn Shopify Benchmarks App
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

![logo-image](assets/Shopify_Cover_Page.png)

In this guide, we will review how to access and use the Shopify Benchmarks App in Snowflake’s Native Apps.

### What is a Snowflake Native App?
[Snowflake Native Apps](https://www.snowflake.com/native-apps/) are deployed by third party companies, like Cybersyn, through Snowflake Marketplace. Instead of customers having to copy data to apps, this technology enables data to be deployed and distributed directly through an app that lives inside an end users’ existing Snowflake account.

### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is a pure Python [open source](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) application framework that enables developers to quickly and easily write, share, and deploy data applications. Learn more about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

### What you’ll get?
A Streamlit application built natively in Snowflake that is connected directly to a database. This application allows users to quickly demonstrate usage examples for the data and then copy them to query on the underlying data themselves. 

This data specifically focuses on benchmarks for Shopify ecommerce sales and advertising spend from a cohort of Shopify stores. The data consists of Shopify store sales, website engagement, and advertising metrics at the store category and subcategory level. The data is derived from a panel of thousands of Shopify stores globally. It is meant to be representative of the Shopify eCommerce ecosystem.

Categories and subcategories are based on modified Google “Verticals” Taxonomy. Examples include: “Apparel > Women’s Clothing” or “Home & Garden > Home Appliances”. In addition to covering the category level, the data includes the breakdown of each metric. Benchmarks are calculated down to the subcategory by geography level.

Sales and engagement metrics:
- Revenue
- Transaction count
- Average order value (AOV)
- Website sessions
- Website page views

Advertising metrics:
- Click through rate (CTR)
- Cost per thousand impressions (CPM)
- Cost per click (CPC)
