# Build an AI Assistant for Telco using AI SQL and Snowflake Intelligence

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

### Introduction

Telecommunications companies face unique challenges in managing vast amounts of operational data—from network performance metrics and infrastructure capacity to customer call recordings, support tickets, and satisfaction surveys. To address these challenges effectively, a unified platform is essential—one capable of storing and processing all data types, whether MP3 call recordings, PDF help documents, or structured network telemetry.

Throughout this quickstart, we'll use **NovaConnect**—a fictitious telecommunications company—as our example organization. NovaConnect operates a nationwide 5G network serving millions of customers, and needs AI-powered tools to analyze network performance, understand customer feedback, and streamline support operations.

<img src="assets/novaconnect-logo.png" alt="NovaConnect Logo" width="75%"/>

This data must be readily accessible for analysis using the latest large language models (LLMs) such as Anthropic, Gemma, LLaMA, or DeepSeek. Ensuring the trustworthiness and security of generated insights is critical, especially when they inform network operations decisions and customer experience strategies.

In addition, developing Agentic AI capabilities allows for natural language question-answering tailored to network engineers, customer service managers, and operations teams who need real-time insights into network health and customer satisfaction.

**In this hands-on lab, you'll learn how to build a Telco Operations AI Agent from the ground up using the Snowflake AI Data Cloud.**

Learn how you can leverage the latest AI technologies right within the Snowflake platform. When AI is deeply embedded in your trusted data platform, the possibilities are endless. We will be exploring the processing of both **Unstructured** and **Structured** data which will then allow the application of a **Cortex Agent** to help discover insights by leveraging **All Data.**

### Data Sources and Analytics

This hands-on lab utilizes a comprehensive telecommunications dataset spanning multiple data types to demonstrate real-world AI applications. You'll work with:

**Network Operations Data**

- **Network Performance Metrics** - Latency, download/upload speeds, packet loss, and availability from cell towers
- **Infrastructure Capacity** - Bandwidth utilization, equipment status, and capacity planning data
- **4G/5G Tower Analytics** - Regional performance metrics across multiple geographic regions

**Customer Experience Data**

- **25 Call Recordings** (MP3) - Customer support calls transcribed with AI_TRANSCRIBE
- **8 Help Documents** (PDF) - Product guides and troubleshooting documents processed with AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT
- **Customer Feedback Summary** - Sentiment analysis, complaints, and feedback categorization
- **Customer Details** - Demographics, plan types, tenure, and churn analysis
- **Support Tickets** - Issue tracking with priority, category, and resolution data
- **CSAT Surveys** - Customer satisfaction scores and NPS ratings

**AI-Powered Analysis Journey**

Your AI assistant will synthesize insights from all these sources to answer questions like:

- *"Which regions have the highest network latency issues?"*
- *"Show me 5G towers operating above 80% capacity"*
- *"Find calls mentioning network connectivity problems"*
- *"Which customer segments have the highest churn risk?"*
- *"What are the top customer complaints this month?"*

This diverse dataset enables you to experience how modern AI can unify structured network data with unstructured customer interactions, creating comprehensive operational intelligence.

> **⚠️ Important Disclaimer:** All data including NovaConnect company information is completely synthetic and created for educational purposes. Business decisions cannot be made based on any outcomes of this lab.

### What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll build a comprehensive AI-powered telecommunications operations platform called **NovaConnect Intelligence** using Snowflake's Cortex AI capabilities. This end-to-end solution demonstrates how to:

- Process unstructured documents (PDFs) with **Cortex Document Processing**
- Transcribe and analyze customer call audio with **AI Transcribe** and **AI Sentiment**
- Create intelligent search experiences with **Cortex Search Services**
- Build natural language data queries with **Cortex Analyst** and semantic models
- Deploy conversational AI agents with **Snowflake Intelligence**

### What You'll Learn

- How to extract structured data from unstructured documents
- How to build and configure Cortex Search Services for RAG applications
- How to create Cortex Analyst semantic models for business intelligence
- How to use Snowflake Intelligence agents with multiple tools
- How to deploy production-ready Streamlit applications in Snowflake

### What You'll Need

- A Snowflake account (free trial works for most features) with **ACCOUNTADMIN** access
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
- Basic knowledge of SQL
- 15-20 minutes for deployment

### Deployment Options

This quickstart offers two deployment paths to accommodate different preferences and skill levels. Choose the option that best fits your workflow:

#### Option 1: Snowsight UI (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most users, visual learners, those new to Snowflake

Deploy directly from GitHub using Snowflake's built-in Git integration. This approach:
- **No local setup required** - Everything runs in your browser
- **Visual feedback** - Watch each step execute in Snowsight
- **Easy troubleshooting** - See errors immediately in the UI
- **Learn as you go** - Understand what each script does

You'll connect Snowflake to GitHub, then run a series of SQL scripts that automatically:
1. Configure your account and create required objects
2. Load sample data from stages
3. Deploy Cortex Search services and Analyst semantic models
4. Create notebooks for data processing
5. Deploy the SnowMail native app

#### Option 2: Cortex Code CLI (Alternative)

**Best for:** Developers, automation enthusiasts, CLI power users

Use the Telco Agent Builder skill for guided, conversational deployment. This approach:
- **Conversational interface** - AI guides you through deployment
- **Automated execution** - Less manual copying/pasting
- **Skill-based** - Uses Cortex Code's agent capabilities

> **⚠️ Note for Trial Accounts:** The **Web Search** agent tool requires **External Access Integration**, which is not enabled by default on trial accounts. If you need this feature, contact your Snowflake representative to have it enabled. All other features (Document Processing, Cortex Search, Cortex Analyst, email notifications) work without this.

### Assets Created

By the end of this lab, you'll have deployed:

- **Database**: `TELCO_OPERATIONS_AI` with multiple schemas
- **Warehouse**: `TELCO_WH` (Medium)
- **Role**: `TELCO_ANALYST_ROLE` with CORTEX_USER privileges
- **14+ Tables** with ~10,000 rows of telco data
- **2 Cortex Search Services** (call transcripts, support tickets)
- **3 Cortex Analyst Semantic Models** (network, infrastructure, customer)
- **1 Snowflake Intelligence Agent** (Telco Operations AI Agent)
- **3 Snowflake Notebooks** for data processing
- **1 Native App** (SnowMail email viewer)
- **33+ Files** (25 MP3 audio, 8 PDF documents)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Modal AI Platform

This quickstart deploys a **complete multi-modal AI platform** combining:

**Data Sources** → **AI Processing** → **Structured Data** → **AI Services** → **Applications**

**Data Types**:

- 📄 Documents (PDFs - help guides, product information)
- 🎙️ Audio (MP3 customer support calls)
- 📊 Structured (Network metrics, customer data, 10,000+ rows)
- 📧 Support Tickets (Customer issues and resolutions)
- 📱 Customer Feedback (Sentiment analysis, complaints)

**AI Capabilities**:

- Cortex Document Processing (AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT, AI_EXTRACT)
- Audio AI (AI_TRANSCRIBE with timestamps)
- Sentiment AI (AI_SENTIMENT for call analysis)
- Translation AI (AI_TRANSLATE for multi-language support)
- Aggregation AI (AI_AGG without context limits)

**Latest AISQL Syntax**: All examples use 2025 AI_* functions

### System Architecture

The NovaConnect AI platform follows a layered architecture that transforms raw unstructured data into actionable intelligence. Data flows from multiple sources (documents, audio, structured tables) through Cortex AI processing functions, into organized tables and search indices, and finally surfaces through Snowflake Intelligence agents and applications.

The architecture diagram below illustrates how each component connects:

- **Left side**: Raw data sources (PDFs, MP3s, CSVs) stored in Snowflake stages
- **Middle**: AI processing layer using Cortex functions to extract, transcribe, and analyze content
- **Right side**: Structured outputs (tables, search services, semantic models) that power the agent

![Telco Operations AI Architecture](assets/architecture-overview.jpg)

The dataflow diagram below shows how data moves through the system to power Snowflake Intelligence. Raw data enters from the left (CSV files, PDF documents, MP3 audio recordings), gets processed through Cortex AI functions in the middle (AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT, AI_TRANSCRIBE, AI_SENTIMENT), and flows into the structured outputs on the right (Cortex Search services and Cortex Analyst semantic models). These services become the "tools" that the Snowflake Intelligence agent uses to answer user questions—combining structured SQL queries with semantic search across unstructured content.

![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture-diagram.png)

### Key Technologies

- **Cortex AI Functions**: AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT, AI_TRANSCRIBE, AI_SENTIMENT, AI_COMPLETE
- **Cortex Search**: 2 search services for semantic search and RAG
- **Cortex Analyst**: 3 semantic models for natural language SQL
- **Snowflake Intelligence**: Conversational agents with tool orchestration
- **Cortex Document Processing**: Automated document processing at scale

✅ **You're now ready to deploy!**

---

### Step 3: Deploy from GitHub Using Git Integration

#### Understanding GitHub Integration in Snowflake

Snowflake's **Git Integration** feature allows you to connect directly to GitHub repositories and execute SQL scripts without downloading files locally. This is powerful because:

- **Version Control**: Scripts are always up-to-date from the source repository
- **No Downloads**: Execute directly from GitHub - no local files needed
- **Reproducible**: Same scripts, same results every time
- **Workspace Integration**: Browse, view, and edit files directly in Snowsight

When you created the Git Repository object in Step 2, Snowflake established a connection to the `sfquickstarts` GitHub repository. This connection allows you to:

1. **Browse files** in the repository through the Snowsight UI
2. **Execute SQL files** directly using `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM @<stage>/<path>`
3. **Create Workspaces** from repository folders for interactive development
4. **Fetch updates** when the repository changes

The deployment scripts in `assets/sql/` are numbered 01-06 and should be executed in order. Each script builds on the previous one, creating the complete NovaConnect AI platform.

#### Choose Your Deployment Method

**Option A: Execute all at once** (in one worksheet):

```sql

### Running the Customization Script

1. Navigate to the SQL script in your Git repository:

```sql
-- Open from Snowflake UI or run directly
@TELCO_AI_REPO/branches/main/assets/sql/99_customize_regions.sql
```

2. Or create a new SQL worksheet and copy the script from:
   `assets/sql/99_customize_regions.sql`

### Available Presets

The script includes several preset configurations you can uncomment:

| Preset | Example Regions |
|--------|-----------------|
| **US Cities** | New York Metro, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix |
| **European** | London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Amsterdam |
| **Generic** | Region Alpha, Region Beta, Region Gamma, etc. |

### Custom Mapping

To create your own mapping, modify the `INSERT INTO REGION_MAPPING` statements:

```sql
INSERT INTO REGION_MAPPING VALUES
    -- (Original Region, Your New Region, Original Prefix, Your New Prefix)
    ('Kuala Lumpur', 'Your City Name', 'KL', 'YCN'),
    ('Selangor', 'Another Region', 'SEL', 'AR'),
    -- ... add more as needed
```

### What Gets Updated

The script updates the following tables:
- `NETWORK_PERFORMANCE` - Tower regions and names
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY` - Tower regions and names  
- `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_SUMMARY` - Feedback regions

After running the customization, your agent queries will return results using your custom region names!

## Conclusion

### What You've Accomplished

In this quickstart, you've built a comprehensive AI-powered telecommunications operations platform using Snowflake's Cortex AI capabilities. You started by processing unstructured data—extracting insights from PDF help documents using Cortex Document Processing, transcribing customer call recordings with AI_TRANSCRIBE, and analyzing sentiment across thousands of data points. This transformed raw, unstructured telecommunications content into structured, queryable data that forms the foundation of intelligent applications.

You then created the AI services layer that makes this data accessible and actionable. Cortex Search services enable semantic search across call transcripts and support tickets—finding relevant information based on meaning rather than keywords. Cortex Analyst semantic models allow natural language queries against structured network and customer data, automatically generating SQL from plain English questions. Together, these services power the intelligence layer that connects users to insights without requiring technical expertise.

Finally, you deployed and explored the Snowflake Intelligence Agent—the "Telco Operations AI Agent" that orchestrates all of these capabilities through a conversational interface. The agent seamlessly combines search services, semantic models, and email notifications to answer complex operational questions, generate visualizations, and send email summaries via SnowMail. This demonstrates how modern AI platforms can unify structured and unstructured data analysis, enabling faster decision-making and deeper insights across telecommunications operations use cases.
