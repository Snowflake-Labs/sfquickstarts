# sfguide-getting-started-with-azure-openai-and-snowflake

## Overview

In this quickstart we will build an architecture that demonstrates how to use Azure OpenAI with an AzureML Prompt Flow, AzureML Notebooks, Snowflake and the Snowflake + AzureML Connector to quickly generate results.

Specifically, this notebook coordinates using an AzureML dataset that was registered from Snowflake and calling a prompt flow to return results back to a Snowflake table.
