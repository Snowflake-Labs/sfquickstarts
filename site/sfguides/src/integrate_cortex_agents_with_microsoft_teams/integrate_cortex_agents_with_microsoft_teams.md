# Getting Started with Cortex Agents and Microsoft Teams
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 5

Cortex Agents simplify AI-powered data interactions via a REST API, combining hybrid search and accurate SQL generation. They streamline workflows by managing context retrieval, natural language to SQL conversion, and LLM orchestration. Response quality is enhanced with in-line citations, answer abstention, and multi-message context handling. Developers benefit from a single API call integration, real-time streamed responses, and reduced latency for optimized applications.

In this guide, we will see how to integrate the Cortex Agents (*in Public Preview as of 01/12/2025*) with Microsoft Teams.

### Why Cortex Agents?

Business users have typically relied on BI dashboards and reports for data
insights, but these tools often lack flexibility, requiring users to wait on
busy data analysts for updates. Cortex Agents addresses this with a natural
language interface allowing organizations to develop conversational applications. This enables business
users to query data in natural language and get accurate answers in near real
time. 

Under the hood it is a stateless REST API that unifies Cortex Search’s hybrid search and Cortex Analyst’s SQL generation (with 90%+ accuracy). It streamlines complex workflows by handling context retrieval, converting natural language to SQL via semantic models, and managing LLM orchestration and prompts. Enhanced with in-line citations, answer abstention for irrelevant queries, and multi-message conversation context management, it offers single API call integration, real-time streamed responses, and reduced latency. Together, these capabilities allow you to search sales conversations, translate text into SQL for analytical queries, and blend structured and unstructured data for natural language interactions.

Learn more about [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents), [Cortex Analyst](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst), and [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview).

### Why Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams is a communication and collaboration platform designed to streamline
workplace interactions. It allows teams to organize conversations by channels,
send direct messages, share files, and integrate with other tools for a
seamless workflow. Microsoft Teams also supports the deployment of bots and apps, making
it a hub for productivity, quick information sharing, and team alignment
across projects.

## Setup Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 12

**Step 1:** In Snowsight, [create a SQL Worksheet](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets-gs?_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg&_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg#create-worksheets-from-a-sql-file) and open [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/setup.sql) to **execute all statements** in order from top to bottom. This is to to create a database, schema, and tables **SUPPORT_TICKETS** and **SUPPLY_CHAIN** with data loaded from AWS S3 for both tables. And also to create Snowflake managed internal stages for storing the semantic model specification files and PDF documents.

**Step 2:** Use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-stage-ui#upload-files-onto-a-named-internal-stage) to **upload** [the **support tickets** semantic model spec file](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/support_tickets_semantic_model.yaml) and [the **supply chain** semantic model spec file](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/supply_chain_semantic_model.yaml) to the **DASH_SEMANTIC_MODELS** stage.

**Step 3:** Use [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-stage-ui#upload-files-onto-a-named-internal-stage) to **upload six** [PDF documents](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs//sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/tree/main/data) to the **DASH_PDFS** stage.

**Step 4:** In Snowsight, [create a SQL Worksheet](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-worksheets-gs?_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg&_fsi=THrZMtDg,%20THrZMtDg#create-worksheets-from-a-sql-file) and open [cortex_search_service.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/cortex_search_service.sql) to **execute all statements** in order from top to bottom. This is to create a Cortex Search service for getting insights from the PDF documents. *NOTE: [PARSE_DOCUMENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/parse-document#label-parse-document-regional-availability) is in Public Preview as of 01/12/2025.*

## Run Application
<!-- ------------------------ -->

Duration: 5

In VS Code, click on **Run** > **Start Debugging** which launches your app in **Teams App Test Tool** in a web browser. If all goes well, you will see an application that you can interact with in Teams App Test Tool. 

Let's ask the following questions.

### Cortex Analyst: Structured Data -- Support Tickets

These questions are correctly routed via the **support tickets semantic model**.

**Question:** *Can you show me a breakdown of customer support tickets by service type cellular vs business internet?*

In a few moments, you should see the following response:

![Q&A1](assets/q1.png)

Now let’s ask this question.

**Question:** *How many unique customers have raised a support ticket with a ‘Cellular’ service type and have ‘Email’ as their contact preference?*

In a few moments, you should see the following response:

![Q&A2](assets/q2.png)

### Cortex Search: Unstructured Data

These questions are correctly routed to the **vehicles info search service**.

**Question:** *What are the payment terms for Snowtires?*

In a few moments, you should see the following response:

![Q&A3](assets/q3.png)

Now let’s ask this question.

**Question:** *What's the latest, most effective way to recycle rubber tires?*

In a few moments, you should see the following response:

![Q&A4](assets/q4.png)

As you can see, now (business) users can directly get answers to their questions written in natural language using the Microsoft Teams app.

### Cortex Analyst: Structured Data -- Supply Chain

This question is correctly routed via the **supply chain semantic model**.

**Question:** *What is the average shipping time for tires from Snowtires Automotive compared to average of our other suppliers?*

![Q&A5](assets/q5.png)

### Code Walkthrough

As you may have noticed, there are four main classes [teamsBot.js](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/teamsBot.js), [cortexChat.js](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/cortexChat.js), [snowflakeQueryExecutor.js](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/snowflakeQueryExecutor.js) and [jwtGenerator.js](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-microsoft-teams/blob/main/jwtGenerator.js).

Here are some things you should make a note of in case you’d like to extend or modify the application.

**class TeamsBot extends TeamsActivityHandler**

This is the main handler that orchestrates the interaction between the user and the application. When user enters a prompt/message/question, it first creates and instance of **CortexChat** class, then calls ***_retrieveResponse*** method. Then, if the response includes a SQl, then it creates an instance of **SnowflakeQueryExecutor** class and calls ***runQuery*** method to execute the query and convert the results in a dataframe that can be displayed to the user. In other cases, the response is displayed to the user which may also include citations.

**class CortexChat**

An instance of this class is constructed using parameters ***jwtGenerator, agentUrl, model, searchService, semanticModels*** and it has method ***_retrieveResponse()*** that calls the Cortex Agents REST API -- which inturn calls other class methods to parse the response.

> aside positive
> NOTE: In our case, we've set up and provided two semantic models to the Cortex Agents REST API via `tool_spec > type: "cortex_analyst_text_to_sql"`; one for extract insights from **SUPPORT_TICKETS** and another one from **SUPPLY_CHAIN** structured data sources. Similarly, you may set up additional sematic models as well as search services. 

```JavaScript
async _retrieveResponse(query, limit = 1) {
    const headers = {
        'X-Snowflake-Authorization-Token-Type': 'KEYPAIR_JWT',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.jwt}`
    };

    const data = {
        model: this.model,
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: [{ type: "text", text: query }] }],
        tools: [
            { tool_spec: { type: "cortex_search", name: "vehicles_info_search" } },
            { tool_spec: { type: "cortex_analyst_text_to_sql", name: "support" } },
            { tool_spec: { type: "cortex_analyst_text_to_sql", name: "supply_chain" } }
        ],
        tool_resources: {
            vehicles_info_search: {
                name: this.searchService,
                max_results: limit,
                title_column: "title",
                id_column: "relative_path"
            },
            support: { semantic_model_file: this.semanticModels[0] },
            supply_chain: { semantic_model_file: this.semanticModels[1] }
        }
    };

    try {
        const response = await fetch(this.agentUrl, { method: "POST", headers, body: JSON.stringify(data) });
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
        return await this._parseResponse(response); 
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching response:", error);
        return { text: "An error occurred." };
    }
}
```

**class JWTGenerator**

This class is responsible for generating a Java Web Token (JWT) for authenticating Cortex Agents REST API calls.

**class SnowflakeQueryExecutor**

The response from Cortex Agents REST API can include SQL query for questions served by Cortex Analyst. This class is responsible for executing that SQL on the client and returning the response as a dataframe.
