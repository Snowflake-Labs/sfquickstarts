        <p>In this guide, you will use Kumo as a Snowflake native app to recommend the top ten products your highest value customers are most likely to buy. These predictions can be used to make product recommendations that users are more likely to buy, leading to increase engagement and sales.</p>
<p>Specifically, you will learn how to develop the following two models using Snowflake&#39;s TPC-DS retail dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer LTV Prediction</strong>: Predict how much money each customer will spend in the next 30 days</li>
<li><strong>Product Recommendation</strong>: Predict the top 10 products that each user is most likely to buy</li>
</ul>

<h3 is-upgraded>What is Kumo?</h3>
<p>Kumo is an advanced ML platform that leverages <em>graph neural networks</em> to deliver predictions directly from your Snowflake relational data. Kumo ML models are powered by a GNN architecture, inspired by several academic papers in recent history. Data scientists simply need to write a <em>predictive query</em>, and then the Kumo platform will automatically craft the proper neural architecture for their data. As a result of this approach, Kumo is able to achieve great predictive performance out of the box, across a wide range of challenging scenarios.</p>
<p>Kumo simplifies the end-to-end ML process by eliminating the need for extensive data preparation, model tuning, and feature engineering, allowing data scientists to focus on generating valuable predictions and insights.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>What are Graph Neural Networks?</h3>
<p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are an emerging family of deep learning algorithms that bring together all the advantages from traditional deep learning to graphs. GNNs can learn patterns and relations on a grand scale, combining features from neighboring nodes and training predictive models across the entire network.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/4363dbdea757f4fb.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>What is a Kumo predictive query?</h3>
<p>Kumo predictive queries are easy-to-use programming interfaces that automate the major steps in a typical ML pipeline, including target label engineering, feature engineering, model architecture, hyperparameter search, and model deployment. Predictive queries are written using Kumo&#39;s predictive query language (PQL), a SQL-like scripting language for describing ML predictions.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>What you will learn</h3>
<p>In summary, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect Snowflake&#39;s TPC-DS retail dataset</li>
<li>Create Kumo predictive queries to predict your highest value customers (i.e., highest &#34;lifetime value&#34; customers) and the products they are most likely to buy in the next 30 days</li>
<li>Train your predictive queries</li>
<li>Evaluate your predictive models using Kumo&#39;s explainable AI tools</li>
<li>Create batch predictions for production use</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll build</h3>
<p>Using Kumo as a Snowflake native app, you will build predictive models for determining customer lifetime value (LTV) and delivering top ten product recommendations to those customers, all within your Snowflake environment. You can easily access those predictions from within a Snowflake worksheet, and deploy these predictions to your production website or email notification system.</p>
<p>Please note that starting and using Kumo as a Snowflake native app will incur metered costs for running the required compute pool. Be sure to <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/installing-kumo-on-spcs#step-3-optional-shutting-down-kumo" target="_blank">shut down Kumo</a> to suspend the compute pool when the app is not in use.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Setting Up Data in Snowflake" duration="10">
        <p>You will first need to install and downsample the public TPC-DS dataset that comes with your Snowflake deployment. The TPC-DS dataset models the decision support functions of a retail product supplier, containing vital business information such as customer, order, and product data. Although you will be downsampling the data for demonstration purposes, Kumo as a native Snowflake app can scale to billions of rows and terabytes of data.</p>
<p>To learn more about the TPC-DS sample dataset, please visit <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpcds" target="_blank">Snowflake&#39;s documentation.</a></p>
<p>The following SQL code will install and downsample the sample dataset—you can run it as a worksheet inside of your Snowdrift web interface:</p>
<pre><code>-- Create a database from the share.
CREATE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA FROM SHARE SFC_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_DATA;

-- Grant the PUBLIC role access to the database.
-- Optionally change the role name to restrict access to a subset of users.

      <google-codelab-step label="Building Your Predictive Queries" duration="5">
        <p>To create product recommendations for your highest value customers, you will first predict <em>who</em> your highest LTV customers are, followed by predictions regarding which products they are most likely to purchase. This entails writing predictive queries using Kumo&#39;s predictive query language (PQL), an easy-to-use, SQL-like language interface for querying the future.</p>
<p>To learn more about predictive queries, please visit <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/predictive-query" target="_blank">Kumo&#39;s documentation.</a></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Predicting Your Highest LTV Customers</h3>
<p>Customer LTV represents the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend on your business during their lifetime. For this quickstart, you can assume that the customers with the highest LTV are the most likely to buy something. Predicting LTV falls under the category of a regression problem.</p>
<h5 is-upgraded>What is a regression problem?</h5>
<p>Because the target variable of this prediction is a real-valued number, the task type of this predictive query is a regression problem. Regression problems involve predicting a continuous outcome based on the value of one or more predictor variables.</p>
<p>The following PQL statement predicts customer LTV, as measured by the total amount of sales each customer is likely to make in the next 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT SUM(WEB_SALES_MINI.WS_EXT_SALES_PRICE, 0, 30)
FOR EACH CUSTOMERS_MINI.C_CUSTOMER_SK
</code></pre>
<h5 is-upgraded>Creating and Training the LTV Predictive Query</h5>
<p>Click on <code>Predictive Queries</code> from the left-hand navigation, followed by the <code>Write Predictive Queries</code> button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/b92d58ba30e0a93.png"></p>
<p>On the <code>Predictive Query</code> page, provide a name and option description for your predictive query. Under <code>Graph Source</code>, select the graph you just created in the previous step.</p>
<p>In the <code>PQuery</code> text area, insert the following PQL statement for predicting how much each customer will spend over the next 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT SUM(WEB_SALES_MINI.WS_EXT_SALES_PRICE, 0, 30)
FOR EACH CUSTOMERS_MINI.C_CUSTOMER_SK
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have inserted a valid predictive query, Kumo will display the task type/description beneath the PQuery text box.</p>
<p>Click on the <code>Next</code> button in the top right-hand corner to continue.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/a60483f9f126abfd.png"></p>
<p>On the <code>Model Plan</code> page, you can review your <code>Run Mode</code> and <code>Model Planner</code> settings. You can accept the default values on this page. Click the <code>Save and Train</code> button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/262ba2524b2066fb.png"></p>
<p>Once the predictive query starts the training process, you will be routed to your predictive query&#39;s training page, where you can monitor its progress in real-time.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/5de92eab6778942.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Predicting What Products to Recommend</h3>
<p>Once you have generated your predictions for customer LTV, you can then extract the customers with the highest LTV, and actively make recommendations to them by predicting which products they are most likely to purchase. GNNs are highly-suitable for recommendation tasks because, unlike traditional models, they can leverage rich graph connectivity patterns to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences and insights that are often missed by other algorithms.</p>
<h5 is-upgraded>What is a link prediction problem?</h5>
<p>The recommendation problem forms a bipartite graph between users and items, where nodes represent the users and items, and edges represent the user-item interactions. Edges often come with timestamps. Moreover, multiple edges may exist between pairs of nodes, since a user may repeatedly interact with the same item (e.g., repeat ordering of the same product in e-commerce).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/ec4ef8807d217123.png"></p>
<p>Given the bipartite graph of the past interactions, a recommendation task can be cast as a link prediction task—one that calls for predicting future interactions between user nodes and item nodes.</p>
<p>The following PQL statement predicts the top ten products your highest LTV customers are likely to purchase in the next 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT LIST_DISTINCT(WEB_SALES_MINI.WS_ITEM_SK, 0, 30)
RANK TOP 10
FOR EACH CUSTOMERS_MINI.C_CUSTOMER_SK
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in only three lines of code, you are getting the best, state-of-the-art recommender model used by companies like Pinterest, Uber, and Amazon.</p>
<p>To learn more, read about <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/hybrid-graph-neural-networks" target="_blank">Kumo&#39;s hybrid GNN model</a> for recommendation systems.</p>
<h5 is-upgraded>Creating and Training Your Recommendation System</h5>
<p>Click on <code>Predictive Queries</code> from the left-hand navigation, followed by the <code>Write Predictive Queries</code> button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
<p>On the <code>Predictive Query</code> page, provide a name and option description for your predictive query. Under <code>Graph Source</code>, select the graph you just created in the previous step.</p>
<p>In the <code>PQuery</code> text area, insert the following PQL statement for predicting how much each customer will spend over the next 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT LIST_DISTINCT(WEB_SALES_MINI.WS_ITEM_SK, 0, 30)
RANK TOP 10
FOR EACH CUSTOMERS_MINI.C_CUSTOMER_SK
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have inserted a valid predictive query, Kumo will display the task type/description beneath the PQuery text box.</p>
<p>Click on the <code>Next</code> button in the top right-hand corner to continue.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/a6847d98064503a0.png"></p>
<p>On the <code>Model Plan</code> page, you can review your <code>Run Mode</code> and <code>Model Planner</code> settings. You can accept the default values on this page. Click the <code>Save and Train</code> button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/92ea590c925b80d7.png"></p>
<p>Once the predictive query starts the training process, you will be routed to your predictive query&#39;s training page, where you can monitor its progress in real-time.</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Evaluating the Model Performance" duration="5">
        <p>Kumo provides a wide range of mechanisms for gauging the efficacy of your predictive models. On the <code>Training</code> tab of your predictive query, Kumo will display various metrics and statistics explaining the results of various neural architecture experiments and model planner parameters.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/816ae7dd57e0c96f.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>The Evaluation Tab</h3>
<p>You can also access evaluation metrics under the <code>Evaluation</code> tab of your predictive query&#39;s detail page, as well as access your holdout predictions within a Snowflake worksheet.</p>
<p>For example, after training your predictive query for determining LTV—a regression task—Kumo will export the standard evaluation metrics for regression, as described <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/regression" target="_blank">here</a>. Similarly, after training your predictive query for creating customer recommendations, Kumo provides evaluation metrics for link prediction, as described <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/link-prediction" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/729f9870d92b2043.png"></p>
<p>Please note that due to the randomly generated nature of the TPC-DS dataset, your evaluation metrics will display less-than-optimal results.</p>
<h5 is-upgraded>Accessing Your Holdout Predictions in Snowpark</h5>
<p>To access your holdout predictions in Snowpark, first click the <code>Copy</code> <img alt="img" src="img/702b041adb8ac2b2.png"> icon in the message directly under the <code>Evaluation</code> tab to copy the command to your clipboard.</p>

<p>Click the <code>Submit</code> button to start your batch prediction job. You will be routed to your batch prediction job&#39;s detail page, where you can monitor its progress in real-time.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/ca169e353505a2e5.png"></p>
<p>Once your batch prediction job is completed, copy the <code>Output Destination</code> to your clipboard by clicking on the <code>Copy</code><img alt="img" src="img/69019669e1056125.png"> button.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/511a7d4c34552fa1.png"></p>
<p>Log in to your Snowflake account&#39;s Snowsight interface and create a new SQL worksheet by clicking on either of the SQL Worksheet links/buttons.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/ae5413c4328be1f9.png"></p>
<p>Snowsight will load a blank SQL worksheet. Paste your batch prediction job&#39;s  <code>Output Destination</code> (currently in your clipboard) into the worksheet and click the <code>Run</code> button in the top right-hand corner. Your batch predictions should appear in the <code>Results</code> tab of your SQL worksheet.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/a2ff667fa7d97f62.png"></p>
<p>For production use cases, your batch prediction jobs can be automated and integrated into a custom application using Kumo&#39;s REST API, or used to power notifications through a multi-channel provider such as Braze.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Cleanup and Shutdown" duration="5">
        <p>Once you&#39;re done using the Kumo native app, you should shut it down so as not to incur additional metered costs. You can do this by running the following command in a SQL worksheet:</p>
<pre><code>SET KUMOAPP_STOP = CONCAT(($KUMOAPP_NAME),&#39;.KUMO_APP_SCHEMA.SHUTDOWN_APP&#39;);
CALL IDENTIFIER($KUMOAPP_STOP)(&#39;USER_SCHEMA&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>Snowflake will automatically suspend the underlying compute pool when the app is idle. However, you can also completely shut down the compute pool if you aren&#39;t using the Kumo app for an extended period:</p>
<pre><code>DROP COMPUTE POOL IF EXISTS KUMO_COMPUTE_POOL;
</code></pre>
<p>You can always restart the compute pool and app at a later time, if needed. For more information about starting/stopping Kumo as a native Snowflake app, please refer to <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/installing-kumo-on-spcs#4-launch-and-use-kumo" target="_blank">Kumo&#39;s documentation</a>.</p>

        <h3 is-upgraded>Conclusion</h3>
<p>After importing our sample retail dataset, we developed and trained two predictive queries: one for predicting customer LTV, and the other for making top10 product recommendations for those customers. We then used Kumo&#39;s explainable AI tools for evaluating our models&#39; performance, and set up our predictive models for production use.</p>
