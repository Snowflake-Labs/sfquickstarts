      <google-codelab-step label="Understand The Pipeline We&#39;ll Build" duration="2">
        <p>Tasty Bytes is a food truck company that operates globally in many countries. You&#39;re a data engineer on the Tasty Bytes team, and you&#39;ve recently learned from data analysts on the team that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales in the city of Hamburg, Germany dropped to $0 for a few days in the month of February</li>
</ul>
<p>As a data engineer, your goal is to figure out why this happened, and to also build and end-to-end data pipeline that can  keep analysts up-to-date on the weather in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how we&#39;ll do this:</p>
<p><strong>Ingestion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Load live weather data from Snowflake Marketplace</li>
<li>Load Tasty Bytes sales data from an AWS S3 bucket</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transformation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use SQL to perform transformations</li>
<li>Create views that we can use for data analytics</li>
<li>Create user-defined functions (UDFs) that perform weather-related calculations to enrich the views with more data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deliver</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver final insights and a live graph of weather in Hamburg, Germany using Streamlit in Snowflake (write the application in Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s get started!</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Weather Data From Snowflake Marketplace" duration="5">
        <p>Let&#39;s start by &#34;loading&#34; the raw weather data into Snowflake. It turns out that &#34;loading&#34; is really the wrong word here.</p>
<p>We&#39;re using Snowflake&#39;s unique data sharing capability in Snowflake Marketplace. Because of this, we don&#39;t actually need to copy any data to our Snowflake account with any logic. Instead, we can directly access the weather data shared by a trusted provide in Snowflake Marketplace. Let&#39;s go ahead and do this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log into your Snowflake account.</li>
<li>Click on &#34;Data Products&#34;.</li>
<li>Click on &#34;Marketplace&#34;.</li>
<li>In the search bar, search for &#34;weathersource frostbyte&#34;.</li>
<li>The first result should be &#34;Weather Source LLC: frostbyte&#34; by the &#34;Weather Source, LLC&#34; provider. Click on the listing.</li>
<li>On the right, click &#34;Get&#34;.</li>
<li>In the ensuing modal, click &#34;Get&#34; once more. Do <strong>NOT</strong> rename the dataset.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a live dataset! No need to write ingestion logic to bring the data into your account. The data is maintained and kept fresh by the provider.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Load Sales Data From AWS S3" duration="15">
        <p>Let&#39;s now load the Tasty Bytes sales data. This data is currently sitting across many CSV files in an AWS S3 bucket. Let&#39;s use Snowflake&#39;s COPY INTO command to load the data into your Snowflake account.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start by creating a new SQL worksheet.</li>
<li>Set your context. Set your role to <strong>ACCOUNTADMIN</strong>, and set your compute resource (virtual warehouse) to <strong>COMPUTE_WH</strong>.</li>
<li>Next, create the database and schema to store the data that we&#39;ll load. Type the following into the worksheet:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE tasty_bytes;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA raw_pos;
</code></pre>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>Run this code by highlighting these two statements and clicking the Run button at the top right of the SQL worksheet.</li>
<li>Next, navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snowflake-northstar-data-engineering/blob/main/00_ingestion/copy_into.sql" target="_blank"><strong>copy_into.sql</strong></a> file in the <strong>00_ingestion</strong> folder of the <strong>sfguide-snowflake-northstar-data-engineering</strong> repo. Copy the contents of this file.</li>
<li>Navigate back to the SQL worksheet you opened. Paste in the code you copied under the two lines of SQL you wrote in the previous step.</li>
<li>Start by creating the file format necessary to load the data into Snowflake. Type the following underneath the &#34;Create a CSV file format here:&#34; comment:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT tasty_bytes.public.csv_ff
type = &#39;csv&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>Run this command.</p>
<ol type="1" start="8">
<li>In the next block of SQL, with the comment <code>-- Specify the file format below:</code>, we create the Snowflake stage that points to the S3 bucket containing the CSV files. It&#39;s currently missing the file format argument that&#39;s necessary during the loading process. Below the <code>url</code> parameter, type:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">file_format = tasty_bytes.public.csv_ff;
</code></pre>
<p>Run this entire command.</p>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>The next block of SQL creates a table called <strong>COUNTRY</strong> in the <strong>tasty_bytes.raw_pos</strong> schema. Run this block of SQL to create the table. Confirm the creation of the table using the object picker on the left-hand side.</li>
<li>Let&#39;s bring it all together now! After creating the table, let&#39;s now load the data into this table using the powerful <strong>COPY INTO</strong> command. At the very bottom of the worksheet, underneath the &#34;Use the COPY INTO command...&#34; comment, type:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">COPY INTO tasty_bytes.raw_pos.country
FROM @tasty_bytes.public.s3load/raw_pos/country/;
</code></pre>
<p>Run this command. You should see a success message in the console. Great job!</p>
<p><strong>We&#39;re not quite done.</strong> We loaded about 30 rows of data into the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> table, but we actually need to load close to 1 GB of sales data. We won&#39;t do this line-by-line. Instead, you&#39;ll use some SQL that we&#39;ve written for you in advance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snowflake-northstar-data-engineering/blob/main/00_ingestion/load_tasty_bytes.sql" target="_blank"><strong>load_tasty_bytes.sql</strong></a> file in the <strong>00_ingestion</strong> folder within the <strong>sfguide-snowflake-northstar-data-engineering</strong> companion repo. Copy the contents.</li>
<li>Navigate back to Snowflake and create a new SQL worksheet. Paste the contents you copied into the worksheet.</li>
<li>Run the entire file at once by clicking the drop-down at the top right, and clicking &#34;Run All&#34;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>This will load close to 1 GB of Tasty Bytes sales data from AWS S3 into your Snowflake account.</li>
<li>The script programmatically creates an XL compute resource (virtual warehouse) used for the loading of the data. Once the loading is done, the compute resource is dropped.</li>
<li>This worksheet contains about 300 lines of SQL. The powerful thing is that you can understand 99% of it because of the SQL you wrote earlier to load data into the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> table.</li>
</ul>
<p>After running the file, you should have all of the data loaded into your account! Confirm the creation of all the tables (and their data) using the object picker to the left.</p>
<p>This completes the <strong>Ingestion</strong> aspect of our pipeline for this lab.</p>

<p>A view in Snowflake allows you to store and access the <strong>result</strong> of a query. This is in contrast to querying multiple tables with raw data to extract insights. The queries that views store can be arbitrarily simple or complex. This helps you query exactly what you need at a much faster speed.</p>
<p>Views also help organize exactly which aspects of data might be valuable, and help with secure data access control. We can use views to power our data pipeline, without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll use these views in our pipeline later on.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Create User-Defined Functions For Calculations" duration="6">
        <p>We&#39;re missing some critical data for our pipeline. Our analysts have requested that we track certain weather measurements using the metric system. We are tracking a country in Europe after all.</p>
<p>They&#39;ve specifically requested that we include temperature measurements in Celsius, and precipitation in millimeters.</p>
<p>To do this, we&#39;ll create two user-defined functions, or UDFs, that are able to take in existing data from our tables and perform the necessary conversions. We will then invoke them later on to derive these new values.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snowflake-northstar-data-engineering/blob/main/01_transformation/udf.sql" target="_blank"><strong>udf.sql</strong></a> file in the <strong>01_transformation</strong> folder in the repo.</li>
<li>Open a new SQL worksheet in Snowflake and paste the contents in.</li>
<li>These two blocks of SQL each create a UDF. One converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and the other converts inches to millimeters.</li>
<li>We need to finish these SQL statements before we can run this code and create the functions. Add the word <code>FUNCTION</code> after each the <code>CREATE OR REPLACE</code> statements. Be sure to remove the <code>/*  */</code> placeholders.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE /*  */ tasty_bytes.analytics.fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f NUMBER(35,4))

        <p>We now have the insights that we need, and we can now also deliver them to our data analysts. We specifically have views that track the weather and sales in Hamburg, Germany. So how exactly will we make these insights easily accessible for our data analysts?</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to create a Streamlit in Snowflake app that will visualize this data for them.</p>
<p>For some context, Streamlit is a popular open-source Python library for creating data apps in Python – no need for HTML, CSS, or any other front-end frameworks.

<li>At the top, create a new Streamlit app. Name the app &#34;HAMBURG_GERMANY_TRENDS&#34;.</li>
<li>For the app location, select <strong>TASTY_BYTES</strong> as the database, and <strong>HARMONIZED</strong> for the schema. Leave everything else as-is.</li>
<li>Create the app and wait for it to boot up. You&#39;ll notice a default, sample app rendered for you automatically.</li>
<li>If the code editor is not present, click on &#34;Edit&#34; at the top. Otherwise, you can see the code powering this sample app in the Python editor in Snowflake.</li>
<li>Delete all of this sample code.</li>
<li>Paste in the Python code you copied earlier from the <strong>streamlit.py</strong> file.</li>
</ol>
<p>This code creates an app that visualizes the data within the views we created earlier.</p>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>Click &#34;Run&#34; at the top. You should encounter an error. On line 14, replace <code>"INSERT NAME OF VIEW HERE"</code> with <code>tasty_bytes.harmonized.weather_hamburg</code> and click &#34;Run once more.</li>
<li>The application should render successfully! Congratulations!</li>
</ol>

<p>In just 54 lines of code, we created a Streamlit in Snowflake application with Python that delivers the insights we extracted from our data.</p>
<p>At the top, you could imagine clicking on &#34;Share&#34; and sharing the app with relevant analyst roles in your Snowflake account.</p>
<p>With this application, we&#39;ve now completed our end-to-end data pipeline. This completes the <strong>Delivery</strong> aspect of our pipeline for this lab.</p>
