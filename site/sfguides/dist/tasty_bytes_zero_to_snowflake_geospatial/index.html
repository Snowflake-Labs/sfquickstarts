      <google-codelab-step label="Acquiring SafeGraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace" duration="1">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>Tasty Bytes operates Food Trucks in numerous cities and countries across the globe with each truck having the ability to choose two different selling locations per day.</p>
<p>One important item that our Executives are interested in is to learn more about how these locations relate to each other as well as if there are any locations we currently serve that are potentially too far away from hot selling city centers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately what we have seen so far is our first-party data does not give us the building blocks required to complete this sort of Geospatial analysis. Thankfully, the Snowflake Marketplace has great listings from SafeGraph that can assist us here.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1 - Acquiring SafeGraph POI Data from the Snowflake Marketplace</h2>
<p>To begin, acquire the SafeGraph listing by following the steps below within Snowsight:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the bottom left corner, ensure you are operating as ACCOUNTADMIN</li>
<li>In the left pane, navigate to ‘Data Products&#39; (Cloud Icon) and select ‘Marketplace&#39;</li>
<li>In the search bar, enter: ‘SafeGraph: frostbyte&#39;</li>
<li>Select the ‘SafeGraph: frostbyte&#39; listing and click ‘Get&#39;</li>
<li>Adjust Database name to:‘TB_SAFEGRAPH&#39;</li>
<li>Grant access to: ‘PUBLIC&#39;</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p> SafeGraph&#39;s Places data provides detailed information about physical places. Our data is fresh, cleaned and provided in a format that empowers the user. With POI data for countries around the world, you can gain insights about any location that a person can visit aside from private residences.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 2 - Evaluating SafeGraph POI Data</h2>
<p>Now that we have the <code>tb_safegraph</code> database live in our account, let&#39;s run the next three queries to set our Worksheet Role, Warehouse and Database context and see what data is available for Paris.</p>
<pre><code>USE ROLE sysadmin;
USE WAREHOUSE tb_de_wh;
USE DATABASE tb_101;

SELECT 
    cpg.placekey,
    cpg.location_name,
    cpg.longitude,
    cpg.latitude,
    cpg.street_address,
    cpg.city,
    cpg.country,
    cpg.polygon_wkt
FROM tb_safegraph.public.frostbyte_tb_safegraph_s cpg
WHERE 1=1
    AND cpg.top_category = &#39;Museums, Historical Sites, and Similar Institutions&#39;
    AND cpg.sub_category = &#39;Museums&#39;
    AND cpg.city = &#39;Paris&#39;
    AND cpg.country = &#39;France&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/324c64fac8317abc.png"></p>
<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> These sort of POI metrics will be immensely valuable in conducting Geospatial analysis to assist our Executives in making data driven location decisions.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get this harmonized with our Sales data in the next section.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3 - Click Next –&gt;</h2>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Harmonizing and Promoting First and Third Party Data" duration="1">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>To make our Geospatial analysis seamless, let&#39;s make sure to get SafeGraph POI data included in the <code>analytics.orders_v</code> so all of our downstream users can also access it.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1 - Enriching our Analytics View</h2>
<p>Please execute this steps query which will enrich our <code>analytics.orders_v</code> by adding all available, new SafeGraph POI metrics.</p>
<p>Within this <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-view" target="_blank">CREATE VIEW</a> statement, you will see <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/comment" target="_blank">COMMENT</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_date" target="_blank">DATE</a> and <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/select#parameters" target="_blank">SELECT * EXCLUDE ..</a> functionality leveraged.</p>
<p>To highlight what our EXCLUDE is doing we are using it to simplify the SQL required to SELECT all of the available SafeGraph columns but not the ones we already have available in the <code>harmonized.orders_v</code>.</p>
<p>This query will provide a <code>View ORDERS_V successfully created.</code> result.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW analytics.orders_v
COMMENT = &#39;Tasty Bytes Order Detail View&#39;
    AS
SELECT 
    DATE(o.order_ts) AS date,
    o.* ,

FROM tb_101.harmonized.orders_v o
JOIN tb_safegraph.public.frostbyte_tb_safegraph_s cpg
    ON o.location_id = cpg.location_id;
</code></pre>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note:</strong> For demonstration purposes the SafeGraph listing already has the Tasty Bytes <em>location_id&#39;s</em> included within. In a real-world scenario the mapping would leverage public <a href="https://www.placekey.io/" target="_blank">Placekeys</a> which <a href="https://www.safegraph.com/blogs/safegraph-joins-placekey-initiative-as-a-founding-partner" target="_blank">SafeGraph is a founding partner of</a>.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>With Point of Interest metrics now readily available from the Snowflake Marketplace without any ETL required, let&#39;s start on our Geospatial analysis journey.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1 - Creating a Geography Point</h2>
<p>Latitude and Longitude are two building block POI metrics we now have access to thanks to SafeGraph.</p>
<p>Please execute the next two queries to re-assume to <code>tb_data_engineer</code> role and create our Geography Point leveraging the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_makepoint" target="_blank">ST_MAKEPOINT/ST_POINT</a> function.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>ST_MAKEPOINT/ST_POINT:</strong> Constructs a GEOGRAPHY object that represents a point with the specified longitude and latitude.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/90b1ce97de56b167.png"></p>
<p>The results we see in the geo_point column will be essential for everything else we do moving forward.</p>
<p>One thing to note here is despite typically hearing Latitude then Longitude this function requires these values to be input in the Longitude, Latitude order.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>Starting with our Geographic Point, we can now begin to dive into some of the powerful Geospatial functions Snowflake offers natively.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1 - ST_DISTANCE</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s first start with calculating the distances in Miles and Kilometers between those top selling locations we generated previously by executing our next query which leverages the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_distance" target="_blank">ST_DISTANCE</a> function.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>ST_DISTANCE:</strong> Returns the minimum geodesic distance between two GEOGRAPHY or the minimum Euclidean distance between two GEOMETRY objects.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>Now that we understand how to create points, and calculate distance, we will now pile on a large set additional Snowflake Geospatial functionality to further our analysis.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1 - Create a Geographic Collection of Points and build our Minimum Bounding Polygon</h2>
<p>Please execute the next query which will take the building blocks from the previous section and now collect all of our Geography Points and build a Minimum Bounding Polygon from them.</p>
<p>Within this query we will see the usage of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_npoints" target="_blank">ST_NPOINTS</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_collect" target="_blank">ST_COLLECT</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_envelope" target="_blank">ST_ENVELOPE</a> and <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_area" target="_blank">ST_AREA</a>.</p>

<p>Look at how much we accomplished within a single SQL query, but we can&#39;t stop yet, let&#39;s keep going to see what else we can accomplish.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 2 - Finding our Top Selling Locations Center Point</h2>
<p>Now that we have collected geographic information about where our Trucks sell the most in Paris.  Please execute the next query which will utilize <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/st_centroid" target="_blank">ST_CENTROID</a> to find the top selling center point.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3 - Storing our Center Point in a Variable</h2>
<p>So we can use this Center Point of our Top Selling locations in a future query, please execute the query below to SET our center_point variable equal to our <code>geometric_center_point</code> result from above.</p>
<p><code>SET center_point = '{   "coordinates": [     2.323399542234561e+00,     4.885933767767676e+01   ],   "type": "Point" }';</code></p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3 - Locations within Top Selling Hexagons</h2>
<p>Using the H3 Cell IDs from the previous step, let&#39;s now produce a list of all locations within these Top Hexagons and the Hexagons Total Sales.</p>
<p>These results will help the business locate areas and locations that we should ensure are always occupied by our trucks.</p>
<pre><code>WITH _top_50_locations AS
(
    SELECT TOP 50
        location_id,
        ARRAY_SIZE(ARRAY_UNIQUE_AGG(customer_id)) AS customer_loyalty_visitor_count,
        H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL(latitude, longitude, 7) AS h3_integer_resolution_6,
        H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL_STRING(latitude, longitude, 7) AS h3_hex_resolution_6,
        SUM(price) AS total_sales_usd
    FROM analytics.orders_v
    WHERE primary_city = &#39;Paris&#39;
    GROUP BY ALL
    ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC
)
SELECT
    h3_hex_resolution_6,
    COUNT(DISTINCT location_id) AS number_of_top_50_locations,
    SUM(customer_loyalty_visitor_count) AS customer_loyalty_visitor_count,
    SUM(total_sales_usd) AS total_sales_usd
FROM _top_50_locations
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY total_sales_usd DESC;
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 4 - H3_GRID_DISTANCE</h2>
<p>To conclude, in the next query we will see if our two Top Selling Resolution 6 Hexagons border each other using H3_GRID_DISTANCE(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/h3_grid_distance).</p>
<aside class="special"><p> A neighbor cell is one step away and two cells with one hexagon between them are two steps apart.</p>
</aside>
<pre><code>SELECT H3_GRID_DISTANCE(&#39;871fb4671ffffff&#39;, &#39;871fb4670ffffff&#39;) AS cell_distance;
</code></pre>
