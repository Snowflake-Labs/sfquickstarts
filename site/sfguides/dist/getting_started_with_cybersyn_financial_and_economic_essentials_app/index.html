<p>In this guide, we will review how to access and use Cybersyn&#39;s Financial &amp; Economic Essentials App.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is a Snowflake Native App?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/native-apps/" target="_blank">Snowflake Native Apps</a> are deployed by third party companies, like Cybersyn, through Snowflake Marketplace. Instead of customers having to copy data to apps, this technology enables data to be deployed and distributed directly through an app that lives inside an end users&#39; existing Snowflake account.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Streamlit?</h2>
<p>Streamlit is a pure Python <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit" target="_blank">open source</a> application framework that enables developers to quickly and easily write, share, and deploy data applications. Learn more about <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll get?</h2>
<p>A Streamlit application built natively in Snowflake that is connected directly to a database. This application allows users to quickly demonstrate usage examples for the data and then copy them to query on the underlying data themselves.</p>
<p>This data specifically focuses on the US banking system and respective financials and performance. The application includes data covering bank financials, locations, corporate structures, and more as well as key economic indicators such as employment (and unemployment) numbers, inflation metrics, and central bank interest rates.</p>
<p>The dataset combines data from following sources to give a holistic view of the current state of the US financial industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</li>
<li>Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)</li>
<li>Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)</li>
<li>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</li>
<li>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll Learn?</h2>

      <google-codelab-step label="How to use the app to query the data" duration="3">
        <p>Cybersyn has developed this Streamlit application on our database for users to get example use cases and demo the underlying data tables. Users can filter a chart then get the SQL query for the underlying database to easily access the raw data in their Snowflake Account.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="overview_gif" src="img/231ae1bab6a2bff.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1: Filter the data in the App</h2>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: FRED Time Series Tab</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter for <ul>
<li><strong>Measure</strong>: &#34;Retail Sales: Jewelry Stores&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Seasonally Adjusted</strong>: &#34;True&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Units</strong>: &#34;USD&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Years</strong>: 2005 to 2023</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 2: Copy the SQL Query</h2>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: FRED Time Series Tab</p>
<ul>
<li>On the chart, click &#34;SQL Query&#34;</li>
<li>Click on the Copy button <img alt="copushape" src="img/6f63c045637f7373.png"> to copy the SQL code</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3: Run the SQL Query</h2>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: On Comparisons by Year tab</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Open in worksheet button <img alt="copushape" src="img/45d49a55c5dedf52.png"></li>
<li>Paste the SQL code into your worksheet</li>
<li>Click the blue play button in the top right corner</li>
<li>Now you have a query that you can modify and edit in a Snowflake Worksheet</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Success! You have learned how to use the Cybersyn Financial &amp; Economic Essentials App!</strong></h2>
