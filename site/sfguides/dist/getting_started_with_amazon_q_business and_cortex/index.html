        <p>Cortex Search enables low-latency, high-quality &#34;fuzzy&#34; search over your Snowflake data. Cortex Search powers a broad array of search experiences for Snowflake users including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<p>Cortex Search gets you up and running with a hybrid (vector and keyword) search engine on your text data in minutes, without having to worry about embedding, infrastructure maintenance, search quality parameter tuning, or ongoing index refreshes. This means you can spend less time on infrastructure and search quality tuning, and more time developing high-quality chat and search experiences using your data. Check out the Cortex Search tutorials for step-by-step instructions on using Cortex Search to power AI chat and search applications.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/5719997101802620.png"></p>
<p>Amazon Q Business makes generative AI securely accessible to everyone in your organization. Leveraging your own company&#39;s content, data, and systems, Amazon Q Business makes it easier to get you fast, relevant answers to pressing questions, solve problems, generate content, and take actions on your behalf. Amazon Q Business easily and securely connects to commonly used systems and tools so it can synthesize everything and provide tailored assistance empowering your teams to be more data-driven, creative, and productive.</p>
<p>Amazon Q Business offers plugins to enhance your application&#39;s functionality. Plugins help streamline tasks and boost productivity by integrating external services into the Amazon Q Business chat interface. With custom plugins from Q customers can quickly and securely connect to Cortex services like Search.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Use Case</h2>
<p>In this use case you will build a Cortex Search service on the free text data contained in the two manuals <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-amazon-q-for-business-and-cortex" target="_blank">here</a> for pump and pump head maintenance.</p>
<p>You will build a Cortex service that allows to you to us plain text to query these documents to get information. It is important to note that Cortex Search can scale much more than this use case. Please check out the Cortex Search documentation <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>The end-to-end workflow will look like this: <img src="img/434e684fccf85f2f.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ingest .pdf files into Snowflake Stage.</li>
<li>Using the PARSE_DOCUMENT() and the SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER() the raw pdf files are converted to a chunked field in a table.</li>
<li>The Cortex Search service is built on the chunked data.</li>
<li>Amazon Q Business is connected to the Cortex Search service with a plugin using oauth authentication.</li>
<li>Users can use Amazon Q Business with Cortex securely and seamlessly.</li>
<li>Along with the Cortex Plugin users can access other AWS data and services through Amazon Q Business</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with <a href="https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowflake/index.html#0" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> and a Snowflake account with Cortex Search.</li>

</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Set Up Snowflake and Cortex" duration="5">
        <p>Download both of the files in <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-amazon-q-for-business-and-cortex" target="_blank">this repo</a> by clicking on each file and clicking the download button near the top right.</p>
<p>Once you have the files downloaded locally you will go to the Snowflake UI and open a new SQL worksheet and run the below code to create a database that we will be working out with. I&#39;m using the ACCOUNTADMIN role here, but you can use whatever role you know gives you access to create objects (databases, tables, services) in Snowflake.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ACCOUNTADMIN;
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE HOL_WH WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE=&#39;X-SMALL&#39;;
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE PUMP_DB;
USE DATABASE PUMP_DB;
CREATE STAGE DOCS 
	DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = true ) 
	ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE = &#39;SNOWFLAKE_SSE&#39; );
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/2ee1af83904c932e.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/cc385716a51e1679.png"></p>
<p>Now that you have the database created you can upload the 2 manuals to a stage in the PUMP_DB database in the DOCS stage by clicking on Data on the left side of the Snowflake UI, clicking through to find the DOCS stage in the PUBLIC schema then clicking &#34;+ files&#34; in the top right to upload the files from your local machine.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/fe8741b90175dbc4.png"></p>
<p>Now, you will run the below code that will parse the data out of the documents into a field in a table PUMP_TABLE, then chunk the fields into a new table PUMP_TABLE_CHUNK.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">--Create Table for text data
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PUMP_TABLE AS
SELECT 
    &#39;1290IF_PumpHeadMaintenance_TN&#39; as doc,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT(@PUMP_DB.PUBLIC.DOCS, &#39;1290IF_PumpHeadMaintenance_TN.pdf&#39;, {&#39;mode&#39;: &#39;LAYOUT&#39;}) as pump_maint_text;

INSERT INTO PUMP_TABLE (doc, pump_maint_text)
SELECT &#39;PumpWorks 610&#39;, SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT(@PUMP_DB.PUBLIC.DOCS, &#39;PumpWorks 610 PWI pump_Maintenance.pdf&#39;, {&#39;mode&#39;: &#39;LAYOUT&#39;});

-- Create table with chunked text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PUMP_TABLE_CHUNK AS
SELECT
   TO_VARCHAR(c.value) as CHUNK_TEXT, DOC
FROM
   PUMP_TABLE,
   LATERAL FLATTEN( input =&gt; SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER (
      TO_VARCHAR(pump_maint_text:content),
      &#39;none&#39;,
      700,
      100
   )) c;
SELECT * FROM PUMP_TABLE_CHUNK;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that we&#39;re setting the chunks up to be up to 700 tokens with 100 tokens overlap. After the initial setup you can adjust these settings as you would like. Additionally, we are using&#39;none&#39; for the format rather than ‘markdown&#39;. You can see more information using the SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER() funciton <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/split_text_recursive_character-snowflake-cortex" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Next, we will run the code on the CHUNK_TEXT field to create a Cortex Search service.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">-- Create Search Service
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE PUMP_SEARCH_SERVICE
  ON CHUNK_TEXT
  ATTRIBUTES DOC
  WAREHOUSE = HOL_WH
  TARGET_LAG = &#39;30 day&#39;
  AS (
    SELECT CHUNK_TEXT as CHUNK_TEXT, DOC FROM PUMP_TABLE_CHUNK);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we&#39;re setting up the Cortex Search service with a 30 day lag so that incremental updates to the service will be made ever 30 days. Additionally, we&#39;re setting up the service so that additional filters can be used on the attribute &#34;DOC&#34;.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Set Up Q Business" duration="5">
        <p>Head to you AWS console search &#34;Amazon Q Business&#34; then select the orange button &#34;Create Application&#34; then accept all of the default/recommended settings for creating your application, make sure that you have at least one user created for the app with a Q Business Pro subscription the select Create.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/f7316b0aefd92c40.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Setting up OAuth" duration="10">
        <p>From the Q Business Application Details screen copy the &#34;Deployed URL&#34; and save it to a notebook.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/298ad94f0b9ba59d.png"></p>
<p>Next we will run the code which creates a security integration in Snowflake that we will use to authenticate with Q Business. The only change you will have to make to this code is replacing the value of the &#34;Deployed URL&#34; from the Q App in the value  below to complete the OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI value.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">--create custom oauth
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION Q_AUTH_HOL
  TYPE = OAUTH
  ENABLED = TRUE
  OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
  OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 3600
  OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
  OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = CONFIDENTIAL
  OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = &#39;&lt;Deployed URL&gt;/oauth/callback&#39;;

GRANT USAGE on database PUMP_DB to role PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE on schema PUBLIC to role PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE on CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE PUMP_SEARCH_SERVICE to role PUBLIC;

DESC INTEGRATION Q_AUTH_HOL;

SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS(&#39;Q_AUTH_HOL&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>After the security integration is created we grant the PUBLIC roles usage on the database, schema and the Search service.</p>
<p>Additionally, after the &#34;SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS(‘Q_AUTH_HOL&#39;);&#34; query copy the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and the OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET. You can learn more about using Snowflake for Oauth <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-custom" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Also, make note of your Snowflake url. You can do this by going to your alias in the bottom left of the Snowflake UI finding your account then selecting the &#34;link&#34; button that says &#34;copy account url&#34; when you hover over it.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Create Cortex Plugin" duration="15">
        <p>Head back to your Q Business application and select &#34;Plugins&#34; under &#34;Actions&#34; on the left side. Select the orange &#34;Add Plugin&#34; button then &#34;Create Custom Plugin&#34; in the top right.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/27fa3406d5ff10c0.png"></p>

<li>the path defined in the openapi schema assumes that you set up you Cortex Search service in the pump_db database and in the int public schema with the the name PUMP_SEARCH_SERVICE. If you did not make any changes to the Snowflake code that you already ran in this quickstart you will be good and not have to change anything.</li>

<li>What is the part description for part number G4204-68741?</li>
</ul>
<p>Q Business will likely attempt to create query,  retype (or re-paste) the question in the query window and select &#34;Submit&#34;.</p>
<p>You will be asked to authorize and use the browser to authorize one time.</p>

<p>You can check the answer against the manuals, it should match! Test out other prompts including the examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the pump head assembly parts?</li>
<li>Should I use a refurbished pump head for maintenance and repair OR disassemble a pump head?</li>
<li>What are the high level steps for Replacing the Heat Exchanger?</li>
<li>What are best ways to prevent the pump from damage?</li>
<li>What are spare parts that are included with this pump?</li>
