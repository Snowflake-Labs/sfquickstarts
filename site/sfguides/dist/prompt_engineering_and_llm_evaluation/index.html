        <p>This quickstart will cover the basics of prompt engineering on your Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to evaluate the responses of different LLMs through human feedback.</p>
<p>By completing this guide, you will learn how to run AI experimentation with different LLMs for your use case. First part of the quickstart focusses on using prompt engineering to generate different model responses by tweaking your prompts. The second part focusses on evaluating different LLM model responses through human feedback.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of what you will be able to learn in each step following this quickstart:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup Environment</strong>: Setup your Snowflake Free Trial environment</li>
<li><strong>Snowflake Marketplace</strong>: Download the data you need from Snowflake Marketplace and use it in your analysis</li>
<li><strong>Snowflake External Access</strong>: Integrate LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT4 to Snowflake using External Access</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>: Use different prompts on an LLM and capture the responses into a Snowflake table</li>
<li><strong>LLM Evaluation with Human Feedback</strong>: Build a Streamlit App to compare and rate the LLM responses and capture the ratings in a Snowflake table</li>
<li><strong>What&#39;s next?</strong>: What other applications can you build for your industry and data, inspired from this quickstart?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s dive into the key features and technologies used in the demo, for better understanding.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Key features &amp; technology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Large language models (LLMs)</li>
<li>Prompt Engineering</li>
<li>LLM Evaluation</li>
<li>Snowflake External Access</li>
<li>Snowflake Marketplace</li>
<li>Streamlit</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is a large language model (LLM)?</h2>
<p>A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Some examples of popular LLMs are <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps" target="_blank">GPT-3</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/algorithms/bert-start" target="_blank">BERT</a>, <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/" target="_blank">LLaMA</a>, and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/" target="_blank">LaMDA</a>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is OpenAI?</h2>
<p>OpenAI is the AI research and deployment company behind ChatGPT, GPT-4 (and its predecessors), DALL-E, and other notable offerings. Learn more about <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>. We use OpenAI in this guide, but you are welcome to use the large language model of your choice in its place.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
<p>A prompt is a natural language text that requests the Generative AI model to perform a specific task. Prompt Engineering is the process of guiding the AI model to generate a specific response by tweaking the prompt text. Prompt Engineering uses a mix of creativity and experimentation to identify the right set of prompts that ensures the AI model will return the desired response.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is LLM Evaluation?</h2>
<p>Since Large Language Model outputs free form texts that may not have the ground truth, it can be difficult to evaluate the LLMs using traditional model metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, etc. There are multiple frameworks in development to evaluate the bias, toxicity and hallucination in LLM responses. However, the most popular and efficient method has been human-in-the-loop evaluation. That is, letting humans rate the model responses as helpful and right.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Snowflake External Access?</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview" target="_blank">External Access</a> helps to securely connect to the OpenAI API from <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index" target="_blank">Snowpark</a>, the set of libraries and runtimes in Snowflake that run non-SQL code, including Python, Java and Scala. External Access provides flexibility to reach public internet endpoints from the Snowpark sandbox without any additional infrastructure setup.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is the Snowflake Marketplace?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/marketplace/" target="_blank">Snowflake Marketplace</a> provides users with access to a wide range of datasets from third-party data stewards, expanding the data available for transforming business processes and making decisions. Data providers can publish datasets and offer data analytics services to Snowflake customers. Customers can securely access shared datasets directly from their Snowflake accounts and receive automatic real-time updates.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Streamlit?</h2>
<p>Streamlit enables data scientists and Python developers to combine Streamlit&#39;s component-rich, open-source Python library with the scale, performance, and security of the Snowflake platform. Learn more about <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You Will Learn</h2>

<h2 is-upgraded>Clone GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>The very first step is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-prompt-engineering-and-llm-evaluation" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. This repository contains all the code you will need to successfully complete this QuickStart Guide.</p>
<p>Using HTTPS:</p>
<pre><code language="language-shell" class="language-shell">git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-prompt-engineering-and-llm-evaluation.git
</code></pre>
<p>OR, using SSH:</p>
<pre><code language="language-shell" class="language-shell">git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-prompt-engineering-and-llm-evaluation.git
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create Databases, Tables and Warehouses</h2>
<p>Run the following SQL commands to create the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html" target="_blank">warehouse</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database.html" target="_blank">database</a> and <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html" target="_blank">schema</a>.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE CUSTOMER_EXP_DB;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA CUSTOMER_EXP_SCHEMA;
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE VINO_CUSTOMER_EXP_WH_M WAREHOUSE_SIZE=&#39;MEDIUM&#39;;

</code></pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Snowflake Marketplace" duration="0">
        <p>During this step, we will be loading customer experience data to Snowflake. But &#34;loading&#34; is really the wrong word here. Because we&#39;re using Snowflake&#39;s unique data sharing capability we don&#39;t actually need to copy the data to our Snowflake account with a custom ETL process. Instead we can directly access the customer review data shared by <code>Clootrack</code> in the Snowflake Marketplace.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Customer Experience data from Snowflake Marketplace</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s connect to the data from Snowflake Marketplace by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into Snowsight</li>
<li>Click on the <code>Marketplace</code> tab in the left navigation bar</li>
<li>Enter <code>Customer Experience Score by Product</code> in the search box and click return</li>
<li>Click on the <code>Sample - USA</code> listing title</li>
<li>Click the blue <code>Get</code> button <ul>
<li>Expand the <code>Options</code> dialog</li>
<li>Change the database name to read <code>CUSTOMER_EXP</code> (all capital letters)</li>
<li>Select the <code>ACCOUNTADMIN</code> role to have access to the new database</li>
<li>Click the blue <code>Get</code> button</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Snowflake Marketplace" src="img/847e3d567fd7de69.png"></p>
<p>That&#39;s it... we have the dataset to work with.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Query the Marketplace data</h2>
<p>Run the following queries to peek into the data we got from the Marketplace.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP.PUBLIC.TRIAL_PRODUCT_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE_VIEW;

SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP.PUBLIC.TRIAL_PRODUCT_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE_VIEW
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also view the shared database <code>CUSTOMER_EXP.PUBLIC.TRIAL_PRODUCT_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE_VIEW</code> by navigating to the Snowsight UI -&gt; Data -&gt; Databases.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Copy the Marketplace data into our Database</h2>
<p>The database and the view we got from the Marketplace are read-only. In order to be able to write data into the table, we need to copy <code>CUSTOMER_EXP.PUBLIC.TRIAL_PRODUCT_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE_VIEW</code> view into another table.</p>
<p>Run the following SQL command to create a new table and copy data into the new table</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS (
    brand_name VARCHAR(100),
    product_name VARCHAR(1000),
    sub_category VARCHAR(100),
    positive_customer_exp NUMBER(10,2),
    sentence_count NUMBER(10),
    month STRING(15),
    year NUMBER(4),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS
SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP.PUBLIC.TRIAL_PRODUCT_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE_VIEW;
</code></pre>
<p>Let us quickly review the data from the newly created table</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS;

SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre>
<p>The table has several columns but the <code>product_name</code> column will be of interest to us. What if we used the LLMs to create a detailed product description from the product_name column? Let&#39;s do it.</p>
<p>Let us create a new table called <code>PRODUCT</code> to store the unique product names from the CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS table.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PRODUCT 
AS
SELECT DISTINCT product_name
FROM CUSTOMER_EXP_REVIEWS
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM PRODUCT;

SELECT * 
FROM PRODUCT;
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p> IMPORTANT:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you used a different name for the database while getting weather data from the marketplace, be sure to update scripts and code in the following sections accordingly.</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Use External Access" duration="10">
        <p>In this implementation, we will use External Access to securely connect to the OpenAI API from Snowpark Python.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 1</h2>
<p>Create a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-secret" target="_blank">Secret</a> object in Snowflake to securely store your OpenAI API key.</p>

</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3</h2>
<p>Create a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration" target="_blank">External Access Integration</a> object in Snowflake.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION vino_external_access_int
 ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (vino_apis_network_rule)
 ALLOWED_AUTHENTICATION_SECRETS = (vino_open_ai_api)

<h2 is-upgraded>Step 4</h2>
<p>Create Snowpark Python function in Snowflake. Let us understand what this SQL query does:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses Python 3.9 runtime</li>
<li>It uses the package <code>openai</code></li>
<li>It uses the external access integration we created in the above step</li>
<li><code>complete_me()</code> function takes the query we pass, the prompt we have defined and invokes ChatCompletion API of OpenAI&#39;s <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model</li>

<p><strong><em>Sample response: </em></strong></p>
<p><em>&#34;Tandoori Mixed Grill is not a cosmetic product, but rather a popular Indian dish consisting of a variety of marinated meats and vegetables cooked in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor. It typically includes ingredients such as chicken, lamb, fish, or shrimp, along with a blend of spices and yogurt-based marinade. The marinade is made using a combination of ingredients like ginger, garlic, turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika, garam masala, and yogurt, which help to tenderize the meat and infuse it with rich flavors. The capabilities of Tandoori Mixed Grill lie in its ability to provide a delicious and aromatic culinary experience. The combination of spices and yogurt-based marinade not only enhances the taste of the meats and vegetables but also helps to tenderize and moisten them during the cooking process. The high heat of the tandoor oven imparts a smoky and charred flavor to the dish, giving it a unique and authentic taste. Tandoori Mixed Grill is often served with naan bread, rice, or a side salad, making it a satisfying and flavorful meal option.&#34;</em></p>
<p>Very cool. Isn&#39;t it? Now we are able to call gpt-3.5-turbo model APIs from Snowflake. You can also use <code>GPT</code> model on your Snowflake data.</p>
<p>Now that we are able to access OpenAI&#39;s gpt model from Snowflake, let&#39;s go ahead and try out the Snowpark <code>PROD_DESC_CHATGPT35_V1</code> function on our Snowflake data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sample response: </em></strong></p>
<p><em>&#34;OOPS!! it is not a beauty product. The Tandoori Mixed Grill is not a cosmetic or beauty product. It is a popular Indian dish that consists of a variety of marinated and grilled meats and vegetables. The ingredients typically include chicken, lamb, and/or shrimp, along with a mixture of spices and yogurt-based marinade.The capabilities of the Tandoori Mixed Grill are centered around its delicious taste and flavor. The meats and vegetables are marinated in a blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, and garam masala, which gives them a rich and aromatic profile. The yogurt-based marinade helps to tenderize the meats and adds a creamy texture to the dish. When cooked in a tandoor oven or on a grill, the Tandoori Mixed Grill develops a smoky and charred flavor, while still retaining its juicy and tender texture. It is often served with naan bread, rice, and a side of mint chutney or raita. Overall, the Tandoori Mixed Grill is a flavorful and satisfying dish that showcases the vibrant and aromatic flavors of Indian cuisine.&#34;</em></p>
<p>Interesting! For non-cosmetic products, the response is not right. Now let&#39;s generate product descriptions for all the products in our products table.</p>
<p>We have played around with only 2 versions of the prompts. You can iterate on the prompts as many times as you want until the model produces desired output.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Comparing GPT-4 model responses from prompt engineering</h2>
<p>After we experiment with different variation of prompts, we need a human in the loop to evaluate the LLM responses for each prompt.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s save the product names and the product descriptions generated by different model prompts in a Snowflake table. Copy, Paste and run the following query in your SQL worksheet to create the <code>PRODUCT_DESC_GPT4</code> table.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PRODUCT_DESC_GPT4
AS
SELECT product_name, 
    PROD_DESC_CHATGPT4_V1(product_name) as DESC_V1,
    PROD_DESC_CHATGPT4_V2(product_name) as DESC_V2
FROM PRODUCT;

SELECT * 
FROM PRODUCT_DESC_GPT4;
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Product Description" src="img/348e258e65a864c4.png"></p>
<p>Let us also add a <code>review</code> column to the table to store the human reviews of model responses.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">ALTER TABLE PRODUCT_DESC_GPT4 ADD REVIEW STRING(2);
</code></pre>
<p>Fun part is you can work with Snowflake data and OpenAI models together using Snowflake External Access functionality.</p>
