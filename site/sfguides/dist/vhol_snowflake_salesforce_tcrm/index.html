      <google-codelab-step label="Use Case Overview" duration="4">
        <p>This guide will take you through the process of integrating Salesforce and Snowflake using Tableau CRM to deliver Customer 360.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, you will discover the ease at which it is possible to build integrated solutions with Snowflake and Salesforce using Tableau CRM.</p>
<p>To showcase customer 360, we will first load shipping data in Snowflake. Then the data will be enriched with weather information from the Snowflake Marketplace. We will then load customer service data in Salesforce, and using Tableau CRM the customer service data will then be synced with Snowflake, where it will be combined with the shipping and weather data. The customer service agent from the Salesforce environment will then be able to have access to the full combined service, shipping and weather data in Snowflake using Tableau CRM Direct Data connector.</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the workflow:</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Setting up Snowflake" duration="3">
        <p>The first thing you will need to do is download the following .sql file that contains a series of SQL commands we will execute throughout this lab.</p>
<p><a href="https://snowflake-corp-se-workshop.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/VHOL_Snowflake_Salesforce/TCRM_V1/files/VHOL_SNOW_TCRM_1.0.sql" target="_blank"><paper-button class="colored" raised><iron-icon icon="file-download"></iron-icon>Download .sql File</paper-button></a><br><br></p>
<p>At this point, log into your Snowflake account and have a clear screen to start working with. If you have just created a free trial account, feel free to minimize or close and hint boxes that are looking to help guide you. These will not be needed for this lab and most of the hints will be covered throughout the remainder of this exercise.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/acfabc61c83cf162.png"></p>
<p>To ingest our script in the Snowflake UI, navigate to the ellipsis button on the top right hand side of a &#34;New Worksheet&#34; and load our script.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/bccece7b2999aed2.png"></p>
<p>The SQL script file should show up as text in a new worksheet.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/48e5fe1c6db356e8.png"></p>
<p>Snowflake provides &#34;worksheets&#34; as the spot for you to execute your code. For each worksheet you create, you will need to set the &#34;context&#34; so the worksheet knows how to behave. A &#34;context&#34; in Snowflake is made up of 4 distinctions that must be set before we can perform any work: the &#34;role&#34; we want to act as, the &#34;database&#34; and &#34;schema&#34; we want to work with, and the &#34;warehouse&#34; we want to perform the work. This can be found in the top right hand section of a new worksheet.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/9eb80d8819769738.png"></p>
<p>It is also helpful to turn on code highlight in the worksheet. This will highlight the SQL command(s) that you will execute before &#34;running&#34; the command. Navigate to the ellipsis button on the top right hand side of a &#34;New Worksheet&#34; and click Turn on Code Highlight.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/93659106e5c50151.png"></p>
<p>Let&#39;s go ahead and set the role we want to act as, which will be <code>SECURITYADMIN</code> to begin with. We can either set this either manually by hovering over the people icon and choosing SECURITYADMIN from the &#34;Role&#34; dropdown, or we can run the first line of code in our worksheet. In addition to traditional SQL statements, Snowflake Data Definition (<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql-ddl-summary.html" target="_blank">DDL</a>) commands, such as setting the worksheet context, can also be written and executed within the worksheet.</p>
<p>For convenience all the SQL commands needed are already in the SQL script. Let&#39;s execute the first SQL command in the SQL script.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
</code></pre>
<p>To execute this code, all we need to do is place our cursor on the line we wish to run and then either hit the &#34;run&#34; button at the top left of the worksheet or press <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Enter/Return</code>.</p>
<p>Once code is executed the results will be displayed below the worksheet.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/3289e7427f445a98.png"></p>
<p>Each step throughout the guide has an associated SQL command to perform the work we are looking to execute, and so feel free to step through each action running the code line by line as we walk through the lab. For the purposes of this demo, we will not be running multiple statements in a row.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Creating Snowflake Role, User, Database &amp; Warehouse" duration="5">
        <p>To get started, we are going to create the Snowflake objects for this lab. You can create objects using the UI, but for the purposes of this lab we will use Snowflake DDL commands in the SQL script file that we downloaded in the previous step.</p>
<p>We already switched our &#34;role&#34; to <code>SECURITYADMIN</code>, a role typically used to create users and roles in the Snowflake account. We will now create our primary ROLE and USER that will be used by the CRM Analyst persona. We will also grant the CRM_ANALYST role to the SYSADMIN role to make administration easier. Highlight and execute both commands.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE COMMENT=&#39;CRM ANALYST ROLE&#39;;
GRANT ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
</code></pre>
<p>Next we will create the <code>CRM_ANALYST</code> user, and grant the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code> role to this user. Please note the password that is set for the user, feel free to change the password to your preference, but <strong>do note this password</strong> as it will be used in future steps to configure the connections with Tableau CRM.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE USER CRM_ANALYST PASSWORD=&#39;TCRMSNOW123&#39; 
    DEFAULT_ROLE=CRM_ANALYST_ROLE 
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE=CRM_WH
    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=CRM_DB.PUBLIC
    MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE
    COMMENT=&#39;CRM ANALYST&#39;;
GRANT ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE TO USER CRM_ANALYST;
</code></pre>
<p>We will now switch to the <code>SYSADMIN</code> role to create the database and schema needed. Databases and Schemas are storage structures used in Snowflake to store and manage objects such as Tables, Views, Stages, Sequences, etc. We will also grant the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code> the necessary privileges on these structures.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE CRM_DB;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA CRM_DB.SHIPPING;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE CRM_DB TO ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA CRM_DB.SHIPPING TO ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
</code></pre>
<p>Next we will create a Snowflake WAREHOUSE that will be used. In Snowflake a WAREHOUSE is a compute cluster that can be instantaneously start/stopped or scaled up/down as needed. WAREHOUSES only perform compute work, while all data is managed and stored in DATABASES, as Snowflake has complete separation between storage and compute to allow for fast and flexible independent scaling. We will also grant the CRM_ANALYST_ROLE usage privileges on the WAREHOUSE.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> It is typically a good idea to create all warehouses with the <code>AUTO_SUSPEND</code> and <code>AUTO_RESUME</code> properties set to avoid using compute resources when not needed.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE CRM_WH
      WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = &#39;XSMALL&#39;
      AUTO_SUSPEND = 300
      AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE CRM_WH TO ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
</code></pre>
<p>The warehouse is now ready to use.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Load Shipping data into Snowflake" duration="5">
        <p>We will now load shipping data into Snowflake to simulate data from internal shipping and financials systems, that are typically doen with ELT/ETL processes.</p>
<p>First we will set our context to the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code>, and the <code>CRM_DB</code> database and <code>SHIPPING</code> schema.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
USE WAREHOUSE CRM_WH;
USE CRM_DB.SHIPPING;
</code></pre>
<p>Next we will create the <code>SHIPPING_NFO</code> table to load the data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SHIPPING_INFO 
   (Account_ID VARCHAR(64), Shipment_Id VARCHAR(64), Shipping_State VARCHAR(4),	
    Last_Modified_Date DATE, Closed_Date DATE,
    Priority VARCHAR(10), Contact_Name VARCHAR(64), SLA_Compliant_textBucket VARCHAR(10),	
    Shipmen_Account_Name VARCHAR(64), Line_Haul_Carrier VARCHAR(64),	
    Product_Description	VARCHAR(64), Shipment_Name VARCHAR(64),	
    Created_Date DATE, Profit_per_Order DECIMAL(10,4), Cost_per_Ship DECIMAL(10,4),	
    Estimated_Days_to_Destination INT
    );
</code></pre>
<p>Next we will create a Snowflake <code>EXTERNAL STAGE</code> to a public S3 location with the data we want to load. Snowflake stages are storage spaces which can be used to load or unload data to/from Snowflake using the <code>COPY</code> command. In this case we are using an <code>EXTERNAL STAGE</code> to directly be able to copy data from S3 to Snowflake.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE SHIPPING_DATA
  url=&#39;s3://snowflake-corp-se-workshop/VHOL_Snowflake_Salesforce/TCRM_V1/data/&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>Next we can load the data into Snowflake using the <code>COPY</code> command. We will use one of the predefined Snowflake file formats for CSV files to do this.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">COPY INTO SHIPPING_INFO FROM @SHIPPING_DATA/ FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = &#39;CSV&#39; SKIP_HEADER = 1 FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY =&#39;&#34;&#39; DATE_FORMAT = &#39;MM/DD/YY&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s have a quick look at the shipping data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM SHIPPING_INFO;
</code></pre>
<p>You should now see the information in the <code>SHIPPING_INFO</code> table.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/aff73c4846080bf2.png"></p>
<p>This data will simulate data from various internal systems.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Snowflake MarketPlace Data" duration="10">
        <p>The <strong>Snowflake Marketplace</strong> has a large number of Data Providers where you can gain immediate access to external data without the need to perform any ETL or transformations. The data will show up as a database in your account. Additionally the the data will immediately be updated as soon a the Data Provider performs any updates. This is an extremely powerful mechanism to enrich your data with external data sources.</p>
<p>First we will grant the right privileges to the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code> role to allow it to add Marketplace data. For this we will have to switch to the <code>ACCOUNTADMIN</code> role first.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT IMPORT SHARE ON ACCOUNT TO CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
</code></pre>
<p>We will then switch back to out <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code>.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE ROLE CRM_ANALYST_ROLE;
</code></pre>
<p>To be able to add Marketplace data we will use the new Snowflake UI. Click on the <code>Preview App</code> button on the top right hand of the Snowflake console, next to the Partner Connect and Help buttons.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/c16ae709b270f4fb.png"></p>
<p>Once you click on the Preview App button a new browser tab will open with the new preview Snowflake UI. On the top left hand corner click on your username and then hover over the <code>Switch Role</code> menu. Scroll and select the the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code> from the list of roles.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/355b76564d9476ef.png"></p>
<p>Now click on the <code>Data</code> menu bar on the left side. Then select <code>Marketplace</code>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/5b0c4b2fe9ca97c4.png"></p>
<p>Once in the Marketplace type <code>Weather</code> in the top <code>Search Data Marketplace</code> and hit Enter/Return. This will provide a list of Data Providers with Weather data. Make sure to select <strong>Weather Source</strong> as provider and the <strong>Global Weather &amp; Climate Data for BI</strong> tile from the list of tiles.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/5285f056b9fe0688.png"></p>
<p>Then click on the <code>Get Data</code> button on the top right side.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/66c32cc1b0af9b5b.png"></p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you experience errors getting to the listing, sign out of the preview app and sign back in by clicking on your username in the top left corner.</p>
<p>In the pop up display remove the current string in the entry field, and type in <strong>WEATHERSOURCE</strong> for Create Database and click on <code>Get Data</code>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/96c960e2f9eb6dd.png"></p>
<p>Click <code>Done</code> when finished. Then on the top of the window click <code>Snowflake Marketplace</code> to return to the listings of Marketplace Data Providers.</p>
<p>We now want to get data to allow us to consolidate geography data by state and zip code. SafeGraph provides a data set that will help with that. Following the same steps as before type <code>SafeGraph</code> in the top search box. Then select <strong>SafeGraph</strong> as provider and the <strong>Foot Traffic Patterns - Starbucks</strong> tile.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/750ec10334ad70e8.png"></p>
<p>Then click on the <code>Get Data</code> button on the top right side. In the pop up display remove the current string in the entry field, and type in <strong>SAFEGRAPH_STARBUCKS</strong> for Create Database and click on <code>Get Data</code>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/838606b2da0299e1.png"></p>
<p>Click <code>Done</code> when finished and close the browser tab that was used for the Marketplace.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Enrich the Shipping data with Marketplace data" duration="4">
        <p>Let&#39;s look at the Marketplace data we got from the previous steps. The Marketplace data will look like databases in your Snowflake account with no need to do any ETL.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you are using the <code>CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</code> as set in the previous step.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first look at the weather data. You will notice there are historical and forecast data, we will quickly look at both. Take some time after each query to look at the data. You will notice the data is available by zip (postal) code and one entry for each zip and day.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE WEATHERSOURCE.STANDARD_TILE;

SELECT * FROM WEATHERSOURCE.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY ORDER BY DATE_VALID_STD DESC LIMIT 1000;

SELECT * FROM WEATHERSOURCE.STANDARD_TILE.FORECAST_DAY ORDER BY DATE_VALID_STD DESC LIMIT 1000;
</code></pre>
<p>Our shipping data was only by state, let&#39;s look at the SafeGraph data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE SAFEGRAPH_STARBUCKS.PUBLIC;

SELECT * FROM SAFEGRAPH_STARBUCKS.PUBLIC.PATTERNS LIMIT 1000;
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the SafeGraph data provides zip codes for states. We can now use that to join with the Weather data and use aggregate function to the weather extremes in the state for that day. To make it simpler to use we will create Snowflake <code>VIEWS</code> joining the datasets so it will always be up to date when the providers update their data. We will create a view for Weather History and a view for Weather Forecast.</p>
<p>We will create the views in our <code>CRM_DB</code> database and <code>SHIPPING</code> schema.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">USE CRM_DB.SHIPPING;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW WEATHER_HISTORICAL AS
    SELECT W.DATE_VALID_STD AS DATE, S.REGION AS STATE, MAX(W.MAX_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F) AS MAX_TEMP,
            MIN(W.MIN_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F) AS MIN_TEMP, MAX(W.TOT_PRECIPITATION_IN) AS PRECIPITATION,
            MAX(W.MAX_WIND_SPEED_10M_MPH) AS MAX_WIND
        FROM WEATHERSOURCE.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY W, SAFEGRAPH_STARBUCKS.PUBLIC.PATTERNS S
        WHERE W.POSTAL_CODE = S.POSTAL_CODE
        GROUP BY W.DATE_VALID_STD,S.REGION;
        
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW WEATHER_FORECAST AS        
       SELECT W.DATE_VALID_STD AS DATE, S.REGION AS STATE, MAX(W.MAX_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F) AS MAX_TEMP_F,
            MIN(W.MIN_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F) AS MIN_TEMP_F, MAX(W.PROBABILITY_OF_PRECIPITATION_PCT) AS PRECIPITATION_PROB,
            MAX(W.MAX_WIND_SPEED_10M_MPH) AS MAX_WIND
        FROM WEATHERSOURCE.STANDARD_TILE.FORECAST_DAY W, SAFEGRAPH_STARBUCKS.PUBLIC.PATTERNS S
        WHERE W.POSTAL_CODE = S.POSTAL_CODE
        GROUP BY W.DATE_VALID_STD,S.REGION;
</code></pre>
<p>We can now use these views to see how it may have impacted shipping. Here is query that joins the <code>SHIPPING_INFO</code> table with the historical weather data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT S.*, WH.MAX_TEMP, WH.MIN_TEMP, WH.PRECIPITATION, WH.MAX_WIND
    FROM SHIPPING_INFO S LEFT JOIN WEATHER_HISTORICAL WH
    ON S.SHIPPING_STATE = WH.STATE AND TO_DATE(S.CREATED_DATE) = WH.DATE;
</code></pre>
<p>In the results you can scroll to the left and see the corresponding weather data for the shipping rows. If you scroll down you will see some shipping data has now corresponding weather data and those columns will have <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>To make this information easier to consume we will create a view combining the shipping and weather data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SHIP_WEATHER_HISTORY AS
    SELECT S.*, WH.MAX_TEMP, WH.MIN_TEMP, WH.PRECIPITATION, WH.MAX_WIND
    FROM SHIPPING_INFO S LEFT JOIN WEATHER_HISTORICAL WH
    ON S.SHIPPING_STATE = WH.STATE AND TO_DATE(S.CREATED_DATE) = WH.DATE;
</code></pre>
<p>You can use this view for easier consumption of the data.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="img/cb3d632a64f5ab58.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Now we will configure the connection to Snowflake.</h2>
<p>Click on <code>Connect to Data</code> from top → <code>Output Connections</code> → Select <code>+</code> → Select <code>Snowflake Output Connector</code>. Enter the Snowflake connection information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection Name - Snowflake Output</li>
<li>Developer Name - SNOW_Dev</li>
<li>Description - VHOL</li>
<li>Schema - SHIPPING</li>
<li>Password - TCRMSNOW123 (or the password you entered in Snowflake)</li>
<li>Role - CRM_ANALYST_ROLE</li>
<li>Warehouse - CRM_WH</li>
<li>Username - CRM_ANALYST</li>
<li>Account - &lt;Your Snowflake account name - see note below&gt;</li>
<li>Database - CRM_DB</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Snowflake account name can be found by looking at the URL in your browser tab logged into the Snowflake UI. Copy the characters after the https:// and before snowflakecomputing.com i.e. <strong>https://abcd123.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com</strong> the account name will be <strong>abcd123.us-east-1</strong></p>
<p>In some cases the region (us-east-1 or other region name) may not be present, in this case just copy the characters before snowflakecomputing.com i.e. <strong>https://xyz1234.snowflakecomputing.com</strong> the account name will be <strong>xyz1234</strong></p>
<p>Click <code>Save & Test</code>. If the details are correct there will be a successful message. Click <code>Continue</code> and close the Connection Source window.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/a430730edea8a19d.png"></p>

<p>Scroll down to <code>SFDC_LOCAL_SFDC DAILY Connection</code> and from drop down select <code>Sync Out</code>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/b8f017ce81cf3732.png"></p>
<p>Check <code>Enable Sync Out</code> and select the Snowflake Output connection. Click Save.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/c4281e18e2d0a3ed.png"></p>
<p>From the drop down select <code>Run Now</code>. You can go to the Monitor section to see when the sync is complete.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/37857c5493bdeb5b.png"></p>
<p>The data will now be successfully written to a table in Snowflake.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Enrich the Salesforce data in Snowflake" duration="3">
        <p>Switch back to the Snowflake tab in your browser. Tableau CRM Sync Out automatically created a table in Snowflake with the Salesforce data. The table name in Snowflake will match the object name from Salesforce - <code>master_customer_case__c</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s have a quick look at the table.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM MASTER_CUSTOMER_CASE__C;
</code></pre>
<p>All the selected fields should show up as table columns.</p>
<p>Next we can join the <code>customer case</code> data from Salesforce with the <code>shipping</code> data from the internal system that we already have in Snowflake, and also with the <code>weather</code> data from the external data provider. This allows us to get a full few of the customer&#39;s case data, the shipping data as well as external factors that may impact the customer&#39;s shipments.</p>
<p>We will create a <code>VIEW</code> to join the data sets together, leveraging the Snowflake views we created earlier. By doing this the view will always represent the latest data as Tableau CRM updates the Snowflake table with new information from Salesforce.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW CUSTOMER_CASE_SHIP_FULL_VW AS
    SELECT C.*, SW.* 
    FROM MASTER_CUSTOMER_CASE__C C, SHIP_WEATHER_HISTORY SW
    WHERE C.SHIPMENTID__C = SW.SHIPMENT_ID;
</code></pre>
<p>We can now have a quick look at the combined data.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_CASE_SHIP_FULL_VW;
</code></pre>
<p>This provides a consolidated view of all the data sources.</p>

<p>This provides the customer service agent with the shipping and weather information to enrich the service case data in Salesforce. In this case we can see that there were very low temperatures and high winds causing shipping delays in the state.</p>
<p>The analytics information can be used in the Salesforce UI for simpler access by users as well.</p>
