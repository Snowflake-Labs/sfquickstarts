        <p>In this day and age, with the ever-increasing availability and volume of data from many types of sources such as IoT, mobile devices, and weblogs, there is a growing need, and yes, demand, to go from batch load processes to streaming or &#34;real-time&#34; (RT) loading of data. Businesses are changing at an alarming rate and are becoming more competitive all the time. Those that can harness the value of their data faster to drive better business outcomes will be the ones to prevail.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of using the Data Vault 2.0 architecture is that it was designed from inception not only to accept data loaded using traditional batch mode (which was the prevailing mode in the early 2000s when <a href="https://datavaultalliance.com/certification/standards-board/" target="_blank">Dan Linstedt</a> introduced Data Vault) but also to easily accept data loading in real or near-realtime (NRT). In the early 2000s, that was a nice-to-have aspect of the approach and meant the methodology was effectively future-proofed from that perspective. Still, few database systems had the capacity to support that kind of requirement. Today, RT or at least NRT loading is almost becoming a mandatory requirement for modern data platforms. Granted, not all loads or use cases need to be NRT, but most forward-thinking organizations need to onboard data for analytics in an NRT manner.</p>
<p>Those who have been using the Data Vault approach don&#39;t need to change much other than figure out how to engineer their data pipeline to serve up data to the Data Vault in NRT. The data models don&#39;t need to change; the reporting views don&#39;t need to change; even the loading patterns don&#39;t need to change. (NB: For those that aren&#39;t using Data Vault already, if they have real-time loading requirements, this architecture and method might be worth considering.)</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Data Vault on Snowflake</h2>
<p>There have been numerous <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/tips-for-optimizing-the-data-vault-architecture-on-snowflake/" target="_blank">blog posts</a>, user groups, and webinars over the last few years, discussing the best practices and customer success stories around implementing Data Vaults on Snowflake.  So the question now is how do you build a Data Vault on Snowflake that has real-time or near real-time data streaming into it.</p>
<p>Luckily, streaming data is one of the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/cloud-data-platform/" target="_blank">use-cases</a> that Snowflake was built to support, so we have many features to help us achieve this goal. <strong>This guide is an extended version of the </strong><a href="https://datavaultalliance.com/news/building-a-real-time-data-vault-in-snowflake/" target="_blank"><strong>article</strong></a><strong> posted on Data Vault Alliance website, now including practical steps to build an example of real-time Data Vault feed on Snowflake.

      <google-codelab-step label="Reference Architecture" duration="5">
        <p>Let&#39;s start with the overall architecture to put everything in context.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dbt_project.yml" src="img/251b7f5870f72299.png"></p>
<p>On the very left of figure above we have a list of <strong>data providers</strong> that typically include a mix of existing operational databases, old data warehouses, files, lakes as well as 3rd party apps. There is now also the  possibility to leverage Snowflake Data Sharing/Marketplace as a way to tap into new 3rd party data assets to augment your data set.</p>
<p>On the very right we have our ultimate <strong>data consumers</strong>: business users, data scientists, IT systems or even other companies you decided to exchange your data with.</p>
<p>Architecturally, we will split the data lifecycle into following layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> extracting data from source systems and making it accessible for Snowflake.</li>
<li><strong>Loading &amp; Staging:</strong> moving the source data into Snowflake. For this Snowflake has multiple options, including batch load, external tables and Snowpipe(our managed service for onboarding streaming data). Snowflake allows you to load and store structured and semi-structured in the original format whilst automatically optimizing the physical structure for efficient query access. The data is immutable and should be stored as it was received from source with no changes to the content. From a Data Vault perspective, functionally, this layer is also responsible for adding technical metadata (record source,, load date timestamp, etc.) as well as calculating business keys.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Data Vault:</strong> a data vault model with no soft business rules or transformations applied (only hard rules are allowed) loading all records received from source.</li>
<li><strong>Business Data Vault:</strong> data vault objects with soft business rules applied. The raw data vault data is getting augmented by the intelligence of the system. It is not a copy of the raw data vault, but rather a sparse addition with perhaps calculated satellites,  mastered records,or maybe even commonly used aggregations. This could also optionally include PIT and Bridge tables helping to simplify access to bi-temporal view of the data. From a Snowflake perspective, raw and business data vaults could be separated by object naming convention or represented as different schemas or even different databases.</li>
<li><strong>Information Delivery:</strong> a layer of consumer-oriented models. This could be implemented as a set (or multiple sets) of views. It is common to see the use of dimensional models (star/snowflake) or denormalized flat tables (for example for data science or sharing) but it could be any other modeling stye (e.g., unified star schema, supernova, key-value, document object mode, etc.) that fits best for your data consumer. Snowflake&#39;s scalability will support the required speed of access at any point of this data lifecycle. You should consider Business Vault and Information Delivery objects materialization as optional. This specific topic (virtualization) is going to be covered later in this article.</li>
</ul>

<p>And without going into too much details, this is a fairly intuitive SQL workbench.

<li>We are going to start by setting up basics for the lab environment. Creating a clean database and logically dividing it into four different schemas, representing each functional area mentioned in the reference architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>To keep things simple, we are going to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role (thou, of course in the real life examples you would employ a proper RBAC model). We also going to create two <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses.html" target="_blank">Snowflake virtual warehouses</a> to manage compute - one for generic use during the course of this lab and the other one (dv_rdv_wh) that is going to be used by our data pipelines. You might notice that the code for two more virtual warehouses (dv_bdv_wh, dv_id_wh) is commented - again, this is just to keep things simple for the guide but we wanted to illustrate the fact you can have as many of virtual warehouses of any size and configuration as you needed. For example having separate ones to deal with different layers in our Data Vault architecture.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Data Pipelines: Design" duration="10">
        <p class="image-container"><img alt="dbt_project.yml" src="img/105e5893bca6e7ac.png"></p>
<p>Snowflake supports multiple options for engineering data pipelines. In this post we are going to show one of the most efficient ways to implement incremental NRT integration leveraging Snowflake <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-pipelines.html" target="_blank">Continuous Data Pipelines</a>.  Let&#39;s take a look at the architecture diagram above to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Snowflake has a special <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams.html" target="_blank">stream</a> object that tracks all data changes on a table (inserts, updates, and deletes). This process is 100% automatic and unlike traditional databases will never impact the speed of data loading. The change log from a stream is automatically ‘consumed&#39; once there is a successfully completed DML operation using the stream object as a source.</p>
<p>So, loading new data into a staging table, would immediately be reflected in a stream showing the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams.html#data-flow" target="_blank">‘delta&#39;</a> that requires processing.</p>
<p>The second component we are going to use is <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro.html" target="_blank">tasks</a>. It is a Snowflake managed data processing unit that will wake up on a defined interval (e.g., every 1-2 min), check if there is any data in the associated stream and if so, will run SQL to push it to the Raw Data Vault objects. Tasks could be arranged in a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro.html#simple-tree-of-tasks" target="_blank">tree-like dependency graph</a>, executing child tasks the moment the predecessor finished its part.</p>
<p>Last but not least, following Data Vault 2.0 best practices for NRT data integration (to load data in parallel) we are going to use Snowflake&#39;s <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/insert-multi-table.html" target="_blank">multi-table insert (MTI)</a> inside tasks to populate multiple Raw Data Vault objects by a single DML command. (Alternatively you can create multiple streams &amp; tasks from the same table in stage in order to populate each data vault object by its own asynchronous flow.)</p>
<p>Next step, you assign tasks to one or many virtual warehouses. This means you always have enough <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-overview.html#warehouse-size" target="_blank">compute power</a> (XS to 6XL) to deal with any size workload, whilst the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-multicluster.html#multi-cluster-warehouses" target="_blank">multi-cluster virtual warehouse</a> option will automatically scale-out and load balance all the tasks as you introduce more hubs, links and satellites to your vault.</p>
<p>Talking about tasks, Snowflake just introduced another fantastic capability - serverless tasks. This enables you to rely on compute resources managed by Snowflake instead of user-managed virtual warehouses. These compute resources are automatically resized and scaled up and down by Snowflake as required by each workload. This feature will be out of scope for this guide, but serverless compute model could reduce compute costs, in some cases significantly, allowing you to process more data, faster with even less management.</p>
<p>As your raw vault is updated, streams can then be used to propagate those changes to Business Vault objects (such as derived Sats, PITS, or Bridges, if needed) in the next layer. This setup can be repeated to move data through all the layers in small increments very quickly and efficiently. All the way until it is ready to be accessed by data consumers (if materialization of the data is required for performance).</p>
<p>Following this approach will result in a hands-off production data pipeline that feeds your Data Vault architecture.</p>

Orders data would be extracted into compressed CSV files. There are many additonal options in <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.html" target="_blank">COPY INTO stage</a> construct that would fit most requirements, but in this case we are using INCLUDE_QUERY_ID to make it easier to generate new incremental files as we are going to run these commands over and over again, without a need to deal with file overriding.</li>

<p>Once this done, you should be able to see data appearling in the target tables and the stream on these tables. As you would notice, number of rows in a stream is exactly the same as in the base table. This is because we didn&#39;t process/consumed the delta of that stream yet. Stay tuned!</p>

<li>Finally, now that we established the basics and new data is knocking at our door (stream), let&#39;s see how we can derive some of the business keys for the Data Vault entites we are going to model. In this example, we will model it as a view on top of the stream that should allow us to perform data parsing (raw_json -&gt; columns) and business_key, hash_diff derivation on the fly. Another thing to notice here is the use of SHA1_BINARY as hasing function. There are many articles on choosing between MD5/SHA1(2)/other hash functions, so we won&#39;t focus on this. For this lab, we are going to use fairly common SHA1 and its BINARY version from Snowflake arsenal of functions that use less bytes to encode value than STRING.</li>

<li>Now we have source data waiting in our staging streams &amp; views, we have target RDV tables. Let&#39;s connect the dots. We are going to create tasks, one per each stream so whenever there is new records coming in a stream, that delta will be incrementally propagated to all dependent RDV models in one go. To achieve that, we are going to use multi-table insert functionality as described in design section before. As you can see, tasks can be set up to run on a pre-defined frequency (every 1 minute in our example) and use dedicated virtual warehouse as a compute power (in our guide we are going to use same warehouse for all tasks, thou this could be as granular as needed). Also, before waking up a compute resource, tasks are going to check that there is data in a corresponding stream to process. Again, you are paying only for the compute when you actually use it.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Views for Agile Reporting" duration="10">
        <p>One of the great benefits of having the compute power from Snowflake is that now it is totally possible to have most of your business vault and information marts in a Data Vault architecture be built exclusively from views. There are numerous customers using this approach in production today. There is no longer a need to have the argument that there are &#34;too many joins&#34; or that the response won&#39;t be fast enough. The elasticity of the Snowflake virtual warehouses combined with our dynamic optimization engine have solved that problem. (For more details, see this <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/tips-for-optimizing-the-data-vault-architecture-on-snowflake-part-3/" target="_blank">post</a>)</p>
<p>If you really want to deliver data to the business users and data scientists in NRT, in our opinion using views is the only option. Once you have the streaming loads built to feed your Data Vault, the fastest way to make that data visible downstream will be views. Using views allows you to deliver the data faster by eliminating any latency that would be incurred by having additional ELT processes between the Data Vault and the data consumers downstream.</p>
<p>All the business logic, alignment, and formatting of the data can be in the view code. That means fewer moving parts to debug, and reduces the storage needed as well.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dbt_project.yml" src="img/edcd2073212da34b.png"></p>
<p>Looking at the diagram above you will see an example of how virtualization could fit in the architecture. Here, solid lines are representing physical tables and dotted lines - views. You incrementally ingest data into <strong>Raw Data Vault</strong> and all downstream transformations are applied as views. From a data consumer perspective when working with a virtualized information mart, the query always shows everything known by your data vault, right up to the point the query was submitted.</p>
<p>With Snowflake you have the ability to provide as much compute as required, on-demand,  without a risk of causing performance impact on any surrounding processes and pay only for what you use. This makes materialization of transformations in layers like <strong>Business Data Vault</strong> and <strong>Information delivery</strong> an option rather than a must-have. Instead of &#34;optimizing upfront&#34; you can now make this decision based on the usage pattern characteristics, such as frequency of use, type of queries, latency requirements, readiness of the requirements etc.</p>
<p>Many modern data engineering automation frameworks are already actively supporting virtualization of logic. Several tools offer a low-code or configuration-like ability to switch between materializing an object as a view or a physical table, automatically generating all required DDL &amp; DML. This could be applied on specific objects, layers or/and be environment specific. So even if you start with a view, you can easily refactor to use a table if user requirements evolve.</p>
<p>As said before, virtualization is not only a way to improve time-to-value and provide near real time access to the data, given the scalability and workload isolation of Snowflake, virtualization also is a design technique that could make your Data Vault excel: minimizing cost-of-change, accelerating the time-to-delivery and becoming an extremely agile, future proof solution for ever growing business needs.</p>

<li>All good so far? Now lets try to query <strong>fct_customer_order</strong> and at least in my case this view was not returning any rows. Why? If you remember, when we were unloading sample data, we took a subset of random orders and a subset of random customers. Which in my case didn&#39;t have any overlap, therefore doing the inner join with dim1_order was resulting in all rows being eliminated from the resultset. Thankfully we are using Data Vault and all need to do is go and load full customer dataset. Just think about it, there is no need to reprocess any links or fact tables simply because customer/reference feed was incomplete. I am sure for those of you who were using different architectures for data engineering and warehousing have painful experience when such situations occur. So, lets go and fix it:</li>
