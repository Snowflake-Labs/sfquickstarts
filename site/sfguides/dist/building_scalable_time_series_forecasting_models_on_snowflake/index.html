        <p>Forecasting is a business process that predicts future events over time based on historical time-series data, and has cross-industry applicability and utility in nearly every organization. Multiple business units can benefit from this modelling technique to more accurately predict performance, demand, or or any activity that can lead to improved business reactivity and optimization.</p>
<p>The Forecast Model Builder accelerates time to value by offering modeling flexibility, a low code environment, and automated model deployment through Snowflake Model Registry. This solution walks through a complete time series forecasting workflow, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model training, and finally batch inference in Snowflake. By leveraging XGBoost, Snowpark, and Snowflake&#39;s Model Registry, we create a scalable and efficient forecasting solution.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Architecture and Key Technologies" duration="0">
        <p class="image-container"><img alt="App" src="img/fd7a2a5bc3bd072d.png"></p>
<p>This solution leverages several key Snowflake features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks" target="_blank"><strong>Snowflake Notebooks</strong></a> is a unified development interface in Snowsight that offers an interactive, cell-based programming environment for Python, SQL, and Markdown. In Snowflake Notebooks, you can leverage your Snowflake data to perform exploratory data analysis, develop machine learning models, and perform other data science and data engineering workflows, all within the same interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview" target="_blank"><strong>Snowflake Model Registry</strong></a>: After training a model, operationalizing the model and running inference in Snowflake starts with logging the model in the Snowflake Model Registry. The Model Registry lets you securely manage models and their metadata in Snowflake, regardless of origin and type, and makes running inference easy.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/partitioned-models" target="_blank"><strong>Partitioned Models</strong></a>: Many datasets can be partitioned into multiple independent subsets. For example, a dataset containing sales data for a chain of stores can be partitioned by store number. A separate model can then be trained for each partition. Training and inference operations on the partitions can be parallelized, reducing the wall-clock time for these operations. Furthermore, since individual stores likely differ significantly in how their features affect their sales, this approach can lead to more accurate inference at the store level.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index" target="_blank"><strong>Snowpark API</strong></a> is a developer framework that allows data engineers, data scientists, and developers to write code in Python, Java, or Scala to build data pipelines, machine learning workflows, and data applications directly within Snowflake.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs" target="_blank"><strong>Container Runtime for ML</strong></a> is a set of preconfigured customizable environments built for machine learning on Snowpark Container Services, covering interactive experimentation and batch ML workloads such as model training, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference and fine tuning. They include the most popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks. Used with Snowflake notebooks, they provide an end-to-end ML experience.</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Solution Setup" duration="2">
        <p>To setup the Forecast Model Builder solution in Snowflake you will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download from Github and then import the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/emerging-solutions-toolbox/blob/main/framework-forecast-model-builder/FORECAST_MODEL_BUILDER_DEPLOYMENT.ipynb" target="_blank">Forecast_Model_Builder_Deployment.ipynb notebook</a> to Snowsight.

      <google-codelab-step label="Exploratory Data Analysis" duration="2">
        <p>Understanding the structure and patterns of time series data is crucial for building accurate forecasting models. This notebook walks through an <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> of time series data, providing statistical summaries and visual insights to inform model development.</p>
<p><strong>Key Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasonality</strong> in time series modeling refers to patterns that repeat at fixed intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles. These patterns can significantly impact the accuracy of time series models, and understanding seasonality is crucial for making accurate predictions. Using Seasonal Decomposition and ACF/PACF analysis, we can understand seasonality better and build models that account for seasonality.<em>Seasonality Visualizations</em><ul>
<li>Actuals plot</li>
<li>Seasonal decomposition</li>
<li>ACF/PACF</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stationarity</strong> in time series modeling refers to the property of a time series where its statistical properties, such as the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure, remain constant over time.  The ADF test is a unit root test that will check whether a time series is stationary.  When time series are non-stationary, other data engineering techniques are necessary to account for the changing time series.<em>Stationarity Tests</em><ul>
<li>Augmented Dickey-Fuller</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Baseline Analysis (Optional)</strong> performs basic non-ML-based forecasting (baseline modeling) on your data which can be used as a comparison for advanced modeling later</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this notebook, you will have a deep understanding of the dataset&#39;s characteristics, enabling informed decisions on feature engineering and model selection for accurate time series forecasting.</p>
<p>To run the EDA Notebook:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to Projects &gt; Notebooks in Snowsight.  You should see notebooks for EDA, MODELING &amp; INFERENCE with your Project prefix.</li>
<li>Open the notebook &lt;YOUR_PROJECT_NAME&gt;_EDA.</li>
<li>In the upper right hand corner of your UI, click the down arrow next to the word Start and select ‘Edit compute settings&#39;.</li>
<li>Select ‘Run on container&#39; and click Save.  You will also do this for the Modeling and Inference notebooks.  (Please note that you will need to use a role other than ACCOUNTADMIN, SECURITYADMIN or ORGADMIN to run the notebook on a container.)</li>
