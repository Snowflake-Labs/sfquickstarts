      <google-codelab-step label="Architecture" duration="3">
        <p>The architecture of the Tasty Bytes ML solution is designed to generate personalized upsell and cross-sell recommendations. Here&#39;s a detailed walkthrough of how we use components of Snowflake ML to complete this workflow:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/fdd108e65197620d.png"></p>
<p><strong>Extracting Features:</strong> This begins with the ingestion of data into Snowflake. Data sources include customer profiles, menu details, and purchase histories. Snowflake Notebooks can be leveraged to provide an integrated development environment where SQL and Python are used to query, manipulate, and prepare the data. The team automates the extraction of relevant features, ensuring that data from various sources is consolidated and ready for subsequent steps.</p>
<p><strong>Preprocessing Data:</strong> Next, the extracted data is preprocessed to make it suitable for machine learning. The Snowflake ML APIs are utilized for this purpose. Using Snowflake ML, the team writes data transformation and feature engineering code in Python. Snowflake&#39;s parallel processing capabilities handle large-scale data efficiently, enabling quick and seamless preprocessing. Additionally, the Snowflake Feature Store is used to create and manage reusable features, simplifying the computation of complex aggregations and moving window calculations with simple Python commands. This ensures consistency and efficiency in feature engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Training a PyTorch DLRM Model with Distributed Processing on GPUs:</strong> With preprocessed data ready, the model training phase begins. We are using PyTorch Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM), which is well-suited for generating personalized recommendations. Using the Snowflake ML APIs, feature transformations are performed and the data is prepared for training. The actual training occurs in the Container Runtime, which includes prepackaged environments with popular Python packages and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. This environment supports GPU nodes, enabling distributed training that scales efficiently without the need for heavy infrastructure management.</p>
<p><strong>Registering the Model and Serving It in Containers with GPUs:</strong> After the model is trained, it is registered and deployed. The Snowflake Model Registry serves as the central hub for managing the model&#39;s lifecycle, tracking versions, and maintaining metadata. The trained DLRM model is registered here, making it ready for deployment. Deployment is fully managed by Snowflake , ensuring consistency between development and production. This environment maintains the same packages and configurations, allowing the model to be deployed seamlessly on Snowflake warehouses or Snowpark Container Services for access to GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>Running Predictions and Visualizing Recommendations on Streamlit:</strong> With the model deployed, predictions are generated. The deployed model processes incoming data to produce personalized upsell and cross-sell recommendations. To make these insights accessible, we are leveraging Streamlit to build interactive dashboards. Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface where business users can explore the model&#39;s predictions and visualizations. This interactive platform makes it easy to understand and act upon the insights generated by the model.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying Personalized Menu Item Recommendations Along with Purchase History in a Streamlit App:</strong> The predictions generated by the model, which include personalized upsell and cross-sell recommendations, are displayed in the Streamlit app. This app shows the recommendations alongside relevant customer purchase history, providing a comprehensive view of the insights generated by the model.</p>
<p>This architecture integrates various Snowflake features to create a robust end-to-end ML solution. From data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and visualization, each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficiency, scalability, and consistency of the ML workflow. By leveraging Snowflake ML, the Tasty Bytes team successfully addresses common challenges in ML workflows, empowering their business with actionable insights to drive sales growth.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Streamlit Application" duration="3">
        <p>The Streamlit app showcases the deep learning model&#39;s predictions, featuring personalized upsell and cross-sell recommendations alongside relevant customer purchase history. This comprehensive view helps users easily understand and leverage the insights generated by the model. The app provides recommendations by gathering data, processing features, and utilizing a model registry for deployed deep learning model inference to deliver menu item suggestions. Various filter options are available to tailor the recommendations based on specific use cases. Users also have the option to save these results for campaigns and marketing efforts.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Run Streamlit Application</h2>
<p>To set up the Streamlit in Snowflake Application,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to Snowsight.</li>
<li>Select the Streamlit tab.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>+ Streamlit App</strong> to create streamlit App. Use the configuration from below screenshot to create the Application.</li>
