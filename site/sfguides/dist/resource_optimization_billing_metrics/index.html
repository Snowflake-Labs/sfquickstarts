        <p>This resource optimization guide represents one module of the four contained in the series. These guides are meant to help customers better monitor and manage their credit consumption. Helping our customers build confidence that their credits are being used efficiently is key to an ongoing successful partnership. In addition to this set of Snowflake Quickstarts for Resource Optimization, Snowflake also offers community support as well as Training and Professional Services offerings. To learn more about the paid offerings, take a look at upcoming <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/education-and-training/" target="_blank">education and training</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/understanding-snowflakes-resource-optimization-capabilities/" target="_blank">blog post</a> can provide you with a better understanding of Snowflake&#39;s Resource Optimization capabilities.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Billing Metrics</h2>
<p>Billing queries are responsible for identifying total costs associated with the high level functions of the Snowflake Cloud Data Platform, which includes warehouse compute, snowpipe compute, and storage costs.  If costs are noticeably higher in one category versus the others, you may want to evaluate what might be causing that.</p>
<p>These metrics also seek to identify those queries that are consuming the most amount of credits.  From there, each of these queries can be analyze for their importance (do they need to be run as frequently, if at all) and explore if additional controls need to be in place to prevent excessive consumption (i.e. resource monitors, statement timeouts, etc.).</p>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>how to identify and analyze Snowflake consumption across all services</li>
<li>how to analyze most resource-intensive queries</li>
<li>how to analyze serverless consumption</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> Account</li>
<li>Access to view <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles" target="_blank">Account Usage Data Share</a></li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Query Tiers" duration="0">
        <p>Each query within the Resource Optimization Snowflake Quickstarts will have a tier designation just to the right of its name as &#34;(T*)&#34;.  The following tier descriptions should help to better understand those designations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 1 Queries</h2>
<p>At its core, Tier 1 queries are essential to Resource Optimization at Snowflake and should be used by each customer to help with their consumption monitoring - regardless of size, industry, location, etc.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 2 Queries</h2>
<p>Tier 2 queries, while still playing a vital role in the process, offer an extra level of depth around Resource Optimization and while they may not be essential to all customers and their workloads, it can offer further explanation as to any additional areas in which over-consumption may be identified.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 3 Queries</h2>
<p>Finally, Tier 3 queries are designed to be used by customers that are looking to leave no stone unturned when it comes to optimizing their consumption of Snowflake.  While these queries are still very helpful in this process, they are not as critical as the queries in Tier 1 &amp; 2.</p>
