        <p>Audio files in call centers offer rich insights beyond text. With Snowflake Cortex Functions and running open source LLM models in Snowpark Container Services, you can extract summary of the call, sentiment, and patterns which can eventually help in enhancing customer experiences. By transcribing audio to text and developing custom analytics, call centres and supervisor gain actionable insights on agent responses and proactive issue resolution, ultimately driving better customer satisfaction. These insights can inform strategic decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and drive revenue growth. From optimizing agent performance to predicting customer behavior, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>In this quick start you focus on a scenario where you are a supervisor in a vehicle insurance call centre company. As a supervisor you have to identify metrics about the agent , track few key metrics like Average Handle Time(AHT), total number of first call resolution, Sentiment count to name a few. With the help of running Whisper model with in Snowpark Container Services we can transcribe the text from audio, get the call duration and using Snowflake Cortex functions supervisor can get all these details with a help of a Streamlit App. Supervisors also get options to ask questions on the extracted audio files using natural language. Following is the solution diagram for building this solution end-end in Snowflake.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 800.00px" src="img/b7c27b7de97aaebf.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Setup" duration="15">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Clone GitHub repository</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll need to clone the repository for this Quickstart. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs" target="_blank">Call Centre Analytics with Snowflake Cortex LLM and Snowpark Container Services</a>.</p>
<pre><code language="language-shell" class="language-shell">git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs.git
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Conda setup</h2>
<p>Open a terminal and run the following commands to create a conda virtual environment and install few packages</p>
<pre><code language="language-shell" class="language-shell">conda create --name demosnowparkdemo --override-channels -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake python=3.8 

conda install snowflake-snowpark-python pandas pyarrow streamlit
</code></pre>
<p><strong> Please update the </strong><a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs/blob/main/connection.json" target="_blank"><strong>connection.json</strong></a><strong> file located within the sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs directory (in your cloned repository) to include the specifics of your Snowflake account, database, and schema. </strong></p>
<p>Once you have created the conda environment. The setup is broken into three main steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running whisper model in SPCS for transcribing audio files and extracting duration from audio file and loading that information into a Snowflake table. As part of this step we are extracting relavent information from the raw text required for building the dashboard, reporting and RAG based chatbot using Cortex LLM functions.</li>
<li>Running a open source LLM model from NumberStation which is fine tuned on SQL queries in SPCS for generating SQL queries from the natural language text (Text2SQL) which will be intergrated into the Streamlit App.</li>
<li>Creating and running a Streamlit app which is the front end for this solution running in SPCS.</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Transcribing Audio Files" duration="0">
        <p>In this step you will run either of the steps below. Step a will make you learn on how to setup the container which does the audio transcribe and extract call duration from the audio files. You have sample audio files for reference that you can use to get the text and call duration and understand the flow. Once you have understood the flow, we have a csv which has got all the data transcribed from audio file and made it available for the next steps to work.</p>
<p>a. Run the following notebook to bring up the Whisper Container for transcribing audio to text, extract durationand creating other objects required for audio2text. This step will make you go through all the steps needed to spin up a Snowpark container services and will take around 20-40 mins depeding on you internet bandwidth as we are pushing the docker image to Snowpark image registry over the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs/blob/main/audio2text/audio2text_setup_code.ipynb" target="_blank">audio2text_setup_code.ipynb</a> found in <strong>audio2text</strong> folder in your cloned local directory.</p>
<p>You can find the model card for Whisper from the following link: <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md#model-details" target="_blank">ModelCard</a></p>
<p>(OR)</p>
<p>b. If you don&#39;t want to create the Audio2text container but load the raw conversation data (which is done in the previous step) into required the raw table then run the below notebook. This notebook reads the conversation from a csv file and loads into a raw table which is further used by subsequent notebooks. <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs/blob/main/audio2text/audio2text_setup_onlyConversation.ipynb" target="_blank">audio2text_setup_onlyConversation.ipynb </a> found in <strong>audio2text</strong> folder in your cloned local directory.</p>
<p>c. Once either a or b steps are executed, run the following notebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-call-centre-analytics-with-snowflake-cortex-and-spcs/blob/main/audio2text/AudioAnalytics.ipynb" target="_blank">AudioAnalytics.ipynb</a> found in audio2text folder in the cloned folder.</p>
<p>AudioAnalytics notebook does the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Cortex LLM functions (using Mistral-7b and LLama2-70B model) do extract various information from the raw audio text and load into Snowflake table.</li>
<li>Doing Call diarization using one shot prompting.</li>
<li>Store the embeddings of the extracted information in Snowflake table required for RAG based chatbot.</li>
<li>Populate a table used by the streamlit app for text2sql functionality.</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Setup Text2SQL" duration="0">
        <p>In this step we are hosting a LLM model from <a href="https://huggingface.co/NumbersStation/nsql-llama-2-7B" target="_blank">NumberStation</a> which is fine tuned on sql queries for proving text2sql capabilities. We are hosting the model in SPCS and are showing the capabilities on how you can fine tune on your dataset which will have the questions and the queries. Using Fast API we are exposing the model as a rest api endpoint.</p>
<p>Run the following notebook to bring up the text2sql Container and creating other objects required to run the container in SPCS.</p>
<p>This is required if you want the text2sql capabilities from the streamlit app. You can skip this step if you don&#39;t want to explore this feature. This capability will be soon replaced by Cortex Text2SQL function once its aviable in public preview. This steps helps you to learn on how you can host your own LLM model, fine tune on your dataset and eventually do the model inference all inside Snowflake platform.</p>

<p>After completing this step you will have a service function which accepts a natural language text and generates a SQL query based on the context we have set.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">select text2sql(&#39;What is the distinct purpose of the calls in the last month?&#39;)::string;

      <google-codelab-step label="Setup Streamlit App" duration="0">
        <p>Run the following notebook to bring up the Snowpark container required for runnig Streamlit App which is the front end app for this application. Below notebook has the steps to create all the objects required to create and run the streamlit app.</p>
