        <p>In today&#39;s fast-paced manufacturing landscape, ensuring product quality early in the production process is crucial for minimizing defects and optimizing resources. With advancements in machine learning, manufacturers can now leverage computer vision models to automate defect detection, improving efficiency and accuracy.</p>
<p>In this Quickstart guide, we will train a computer vision model for multiclass defect detection using <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs" target="_blank">Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime</a> easily and efficiently. The dataset comprises labeled Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) with annotations including defect labels and bounding boxes for each image. This approach aims to help manufacturers implement early Quality Control, reducing costs, time, and resource usage in production processes.</p>
<p>The process includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preprocessing the dataset, which involves using the annotated data with labels and bounding boxes information for each image.</li>
<li>Convert the image to a base64 bytes and store the contents in Snowflake table</li>
<li>Training a PyTorch RCNN Object Detection model with distributed processing on multi-GPUs.</li>
<li>Registering the trained model in the Snowflake Model Registry.</li>
<li>Running detections and visualizing recommendations in a Streamlit app.</li>
<li>Displaying inference results for any selected PCB image within the Streamlit app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>What is Snowflake ML?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/" target="_blank">Snowflake ML</a> is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning in a single platform on top of your governed data.

      <google-codelab-step label="Setup Environment" duration="2">
        <p>This section will walk you through creating various objects.  The repository with the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-defect-detection-using-distributed-pytorch-with-snowflake-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2 is-upgraded>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>We will work with two notebooks. The first one, <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-defect-detection-using-distributed-pytorch-with-snowflake-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/0_data_preparation_run_in_local_IDE.ipynb" target="_blank">0_data_preparation_run_in_local_IDE.ipynb</a>, handles the creation of necessary Snowflake objects, compute instances, and data loading from a third-party dataset.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>:<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Image Data Processing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Read image files and encode their content in Base64 format.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p>Once the setup is complete, proceed to the next step to begin distributed model training.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Distributed Model Training in Snowflake Notebooks" duration="2">
        <p>It is time to set up a distributed training pipeline for training a PyTorch-based Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model for multiclass defect detection. The training is performed on a dataset of images (specifically, PCBs) with annotations for bounding boxes and labels, using Snowflake&#39;s Container Runtime, and utilizes GPUs for accelerated training.</p>
<p>Import the notebook available <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-defect-detection-using-distributed-pytorch-with-snowflake-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/1_Distributed_Model_Training_Snowflake_Notebooks.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>In Snowsight -&gt; Navigate to Project &gt; Notebooks from the left menu bar. Import the .ipynb file you have downloaded into your Snowflake Notebook by using the Import from .ipynb button located on the top right of the Notebooks page. Choose the database, schema, Compute pool and the warehouse that was created earlier.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s break down step by step what the training code performs:</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.1 Distributed Setup</h2>
<p>We will explore specific syntax in the distributed trainer that coordinates the training across multiple GPUs.</p>
<ul>
<li>context = get_context() &amp; rank = context.get_rank(): The get_context() function from Snowflake&#39;s framework provides the worker&#39;s rank (ID in the distributed system).</li>
<li>dist.init_process_group(backend=&#34;nccl&#34;): Initializes the process group for distributed training. NCCL is a backend optimized for multi-GPU training.</li>
<li>torch.cuda.device(rank): Ensures the model runs on the specific GPU based on the rank of the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.2 Custom Dataset: FCBData</h2>
<ul>
<li>IterableDataset: This class wraps the source dataset (PCB images with annotations) to make it iterable for training.</li>
<li>Image Loading: The contents from IMAGE_DATA is decoded from Base64, loaded as a PIL image, and then transformed into a tensor.</li>
<li>Bounding Boxes and Labels: Extracts bounding box coordinates (XMIN, YMIN, XMAX, YMAX) and defect class labels from the dataset.Prepares a target dictionary containing the bounding boxes, labels, image IDs, and other metadata required by the Faster R-CNN model.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.3 Model Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Loading Pre-trained Model: <ul>
<li>weights = FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.DEFAULT: Loads the pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with ResNet50 as the backbone.</li>
<li>num_classes = 6: Sets the number of classes (including background) for defect detection.</li>
<li>FastRCNNPredictor: Modifies the model&#39;s prediction head to match the custom number of classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The model is moved to the appropriate GPU (model.to(rank)) and wrapped in Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.4 Model Training Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>optimizer and lr_scheduler: Adam optimizer is used to update model parameters. The learning rate is reduced every 3 epochs (StepLR).</li>
<li>DataLoader: Handles loading the dataset into batches. collate_fn groups the data into batches because the Faster RCNN model requires a custom way to handle images and targets together. Pinning memory to GPU: By specifying pin_memory=True, the data loading process is optimized for GPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.5 Training Loop</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each epoch: <ul>
<li>The model switches to training mode (model.train()).</li>
<li>The images and targets are moved to the corresponding GPU for training.</li>
<li>The loss is computed by the model on each batch of images. The optimizer updates the model weights based on the computed loss and the learning rate is updated after each epoch via the scheduler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3.6 Save model dict and Logging the model to Snowflake Registry</h2>
<ul>
<li>torch.save(model.module.state_dict(), model_file): Saves the trained model (only on the master node, rank 0) to a temporary file /tmp/models/detectionmodel.pt</li>
<li>Using a custom model wrapper class  DefectDetectionModel(), we use the trained model to be register in Snowflake registry with a model name, version, and the other parameters.</li>
</ul>
