        <p>Analyzing Location specific data in order to make decisions often requires ‘niche&#39; techniques which are often worked on by ‘geography&#39; experts.   In snowflake, everyone can be an expert in any location in which they need to understand - whether it&#39;s points of interest, transport links or government boundaries - all is feasible using standard functionality available within Snowflake.</p>
<p>Already, there are so many location specific datasets available within the <strong>Snowflake Marketplace</strong> which significantly reduces data ingestion and engineering time.  Getting access to these datasets are as simple as <strong>Get Data</strong>, where you will enjoy leveraging location specific features using either SQL Queries or Snowpark Dataframes.  And these result sets are then rendered easily using <strong>Streamlit in Snowflake</strong> dashboards.</p>
<p><strong>Snowflake Cortex LLMs</strong> - are used to save the analyst, engineer or even BI developer time - which can help a multitude of tasks - from improving the readability of location tooltips, to the generation or synthetic data for testing purposes.</p>
<p>In this quickstart, we will be leveraging the the tools within Snowflake to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualise</strong> the location of train stations within the north of england and understand where nearby restaurants are located</li>
<li><strong>Discover</strong> where the locations of Large events are and where they may impact stations and Restaurants</li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> the weather conditions which might impact train stations</li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong><ul>
<li>A warning letter to the MP after discovering potential risk</li>
<li>Synthezised events events which might happen and will impact services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visualise</strong>  the data using Streamlit</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Lab Flow</h2>
<p>Here is a flow of what you will achieve if you complete all steps in the quickstart.  You will be reminded of where you are at key intervals.</p>

<p>In Snowsight, go back to the home page and select <strong>Projects</strong> » <strong>Notebooks</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="img/8282120b42a156dd.png"> Observe the alternative actions - you can also import a notebook or create one from github repository  (if you have github connected to snowflake).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/58366180795d0d44.png"></p>
<p>Today we will be creating a new notebook from scratch.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/61ef6b31feeacfc6.png"></p>
<p>In <strong>Notebook location</strong>, select BUILD_UK from the list of available databases and NOTEBOOKS from the available schemas. All data within the notebook will be held inside the chosen database and schema and will sit inside an automatically generated stage. Select the BUILD_UK_WAREHOUSE and press <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If you wish, you can import the previously created notebook from the following location:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-using-snowflake-cortex-and-streamlit-with-geospatial-data/blob/main/Trains%20and%20Restaurants.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook in Github</a></p>
<p>However, to experience the creation of the notebook yourself, carry on with the blank notebook, and copy/paste the code as we go along.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Creating your first Map</h3>
<p>Once the notebook has loaded, Remove all cells in the notebook.  You should see something like this:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/357b1a2e4ce66951.png"></p>
<p>Before we start working in our notebook, we will add an additional package which is not installed as default.  This package is available within the Anaconda Snowflake channel and is easily accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Add the Pydeck package for visualising location data</strong></p>
<p>In the top menu, under Packages » Anaconda Packages, import pydeck.  You need this to render maps.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/ad59e7e14a9f7a3e.png"></p>
<p>Now we have all the packages we need.  Lets start the notebook by pressing <strong>Start</strong> which is at the top right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/aa6d6a9b1947ebdd.png"></p>
<p>You will be using a variety of Snowflake functions to do some transformation tasks.  Some of the functions are built into the snowpark library (such as array_agg, parse_json), others we need to call using the <strong>call_function</strong> module.  <strong>call_function</strong> allows the user to leverage ANY Snowflake scalar function - you can use this for both built in as well as user defined functions.</p>
<p>All functions are held inside the <strong>snowflake.snowpark.functions</strong> module.</p>
<p>We will import the call_function, streamlit library, json, numpy, pandas and pydeck packages.  For pydeck, you will need to add the package as this is not installed by default.</p>
<p>Click on the + Python button to add a new Python cell.  On the top left hand corner of the screen, you can rename your cell from ‘cell1&#39; to something more meaningful.  This is useful for debugging purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Rename</strong> cell1 to libraries by typing over the text ‘cell1&#39;.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following code into the newly created cell.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python"># Import python packages
import streamlit as st
from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import *

    &#34;&#34;&#34;
)

# Get the current credentials
session = get_active_session()
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/321c9d3700957441.png"></p>
<p>Add a new python cell by hovering over the bottom edge of the cell and select Python.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/bf5f0ef6ac5a20cc.png"></p>
<p>Rename the the cell to <strong>n_trains_data</strong></p>
<p>We will firstly leverage the Northern Trains dataset to filter the carto overture maps places dataset.  We want to do this in order to get Points of interests that are relevant for the Northern Trains locality.  Joining by each Station Code would be resource hungry - plus we do not want to join by exact locations, only by roughly where all of the train stations are situated.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Boundary Box to filter the data based on Northern Trains</strong></p>
<p>We will be seeing where Northern Train stations are and will create a boundary box to filter all our data so it will be only within the boundaries of the train stations.  Firstly, lets find out where the stations are so we can effectively draw a boundary box around it.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the code into the new python cell and run this notebook cell:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">trains_latlon = session.table(&#39;NORTHERN_TRAINS_STATION_DATA.TESTING.&#34;StationLatLong&#34;&#39;)

st.markdown(&#39;#### A dataframe which shows all the train stations&#39;)
st.dataframe(trains_latlon)
st.map(trains_latlon, latitude=&#39;Latitude&#39;, longitude=&#39;Longitude&#39;)

</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example of what you should see</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/d0eb08699fc4c74d.png"></p>
<p>We have created a dataframe which is simply selecting the shared station table.  We have also leveraged Streamlit to create a title,  leveraged st.dataframe to display the snowpark dataframe in a clear way, and finally created a simple map using the streamlit <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.map" target="_blank">st.map</a> function.</p>
<p>st.map is useful for quickly generating simple maps by rendering latitude and longitude as points.  Pydeck however, has more sophisticated capabilities such as rendering lines, points, polygons and H3 indexes.  We will be leveraging the Pydeck library in the next step</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Create a Boundary for filtering purposes" duration="10">
        <p>You previously loaded the places dataset from Carto Overture maps.  This dataset offers a comprehensive list of places of interest across the world such as restaurants, bars and schools.  We want to filter this dataset to only list places of interest that occur within the Northern Trains locality.  Creating a Boundary box is the easiest option.</p>
<p>Copy and Paste the following into a new cell and name the new cell <strong>boundary_box</strong></p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">#create a point from the coordinates
envelope = trains_latlon.with_column(&#39;POINT&#39;,call_function(&#39;ST_MAKEPOINT&#39;,col(&#39;&#34;Longitude&#34;&#39;),col(&#39;&#34;Latitude&#34;&#39;)))

#collect all the points into one row of data
envelope = envelope.select(call_function(&#39;ST_COLLECT&#39;,col(&#39;POINT&#39;)).alias(&#39;POINTS&#39;))

#### convert from geography to geometry
envelope = envelope.select(to_geometry(&#39;POINTS&#39;).alias(&#39;POINTS&#39;))


#create a rectangular shape which boarders the minimum possible size which covers all of the points
envelope = envelope.select(call_function(&#39;ST_ENVELOPE&#39;,col(&#39;POINTS&#39;)).alias(&#39;BOUNDARY&#39;))

#convert back to geography
envelope = envelope.select(to_geography(&#39;BOUNDARY&#39;).alias(&#39;BOUNDARY&#39;))
envelope.collect()[0][0]

</code></pre>
<p>You will see this has generated 5 sets of coordinates in order to draw the boundary box.</p>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> Every <strong>valid</strong> polygon will have the same last pair of coordinates as the first pair.   Lets visualise what this looks like using the library pydeck.  Although st.map is useful for simple quick visualisation of points, pydeck has the ability to visualise lines, points and polygons in 2D and 3D.  It also has layer options for lines, points, icons and H3 indexes.</p>
<p>https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p>
<p>Add a new Python cell and name it <strong>boundary_layer</strong>.  Copy and paste the following:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">#find the centre point so the map will render from that location

centre = envelope.with_column(&#39;CENTROID&#39;,call_function(&#39;ST_CENTROID&#39;,col(&#39;BOUNDARY&#39;)))
centre = centre.with_column(&#39;LON&#39;,call_function(&#39;ST_X&#39;,col(&#39;CENTROID&#39;)))
centre = centre.with_column(&#39;LAT&#39;,call_function(&#39;ST_Y&#39;,col(&#39;CENTROID&#39;)))

#create LON and LAT variables

centrepd = centre.select(&#39;LON&#39;,&#39;LAT&#39;).to_pandas()
LON = centrepd.LON.iloc[0]
LAT = centrepd.LAT.iloc[0]

### transform the data in pandas so the pydeck visualisation tool can view it as a polygon

envelopepd = envelope.to_pandas()
envelopepd[&#34;coordinates&#34;] = envelopepd[&#34;BOUNDARY&#34;].apply(lambda row: json.loads(row)[&#34;coordinates&#34;][0])


####visualise on a map

#### create a layer - this layer will visualise the rectangle

polygon_layer = pdk.Layer(
            &#34;PolygonLayer&#34;,
            envelopepd,
            opacity=0.3,
            get_polygon=&#34;coordinates&#34;,
            filled=True,
            get_fill_color=[16, 14, 40],
            auto_highlight=True,
            pickable=False,
        )

 
#### render the map 
    
st.pydeck_chart(pdk.Deck(
    map_style=None,
    initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(
        latitude=LAT,
        longitude=LON,
        zoom=5,
        height=400
        ),
    
layers= [polygon_layer]

))
</code></pre>
<p>You will see that to render the map, we present the data in a format for pydeck to accurately read.  The final transformed dataset is a pandas dDataframe.  We specify the dataframe in a pydeck layer, then apply this layer to a streamlit pydeck chart.  If we want, we can use the same logic in order to create a streamlit app.  Snowflake Notebooks are great as you can render streamlit on the fly - without having to run the ‘app&#39; separately.</p>
<p>When you run the cell, the boundary box should look like this:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="boundarybox" src="img/51dabd1db7edcb19.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Filtering the data using the boundary box" duration="10">
        <p>Next, lets leverage and filter the overture maps so these will only consist of data within this area.  Overture maps consist of location data across the entire globe.</p>
<p>Create and preview the places dataframe - we are also filtering to only display places in the UK.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the python code into a new python cell.  Name the cell <strong>places_dataset</strong></p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_1 = session.table(&#39;OVERTURE_MAPS__PLACES.CARTO.PLACE&#39;)

places_1.limit(3)
</code></pre>
<p>When you run the cell, you will see there is a lot of semi structured data returned.  We will use snowflake&#39;s native <strong>semi structured</strong> querying capability to take key elements out of the data which includes information concerning the location</p>
<p>In a new cell which you will name <strong>places_refined</strong>, paste the following and run the cell:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_2 = places_1.select(col(&#39;NAMES&#39;)[&#39;primary&#39;].astype(StringType()).alias(&#39;NAME&#39;),

places_2.limit(10)
</code></pre>
<p>This is what you should see.  The exact dataset set may ot be the same as the screenshot but will contain the same type of data. <img alt="semi_structured_filtered" src="img/fdb8c290fe711ba2.png"></p>
<p>You will now filter the data to only view places which are categorised as <strong>train_station</strong>.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the code below into a new <strong>python</strong> cell.  Name the cell <strong>places_filtered_boundary</strong></p>

<p>We can view the points on a map easily by using st.map(places) but as pydeck has many more options such as different mark types, tool tips and layers we will create an additional pydeck layer which adds this data to the previously created data layer.  When you hover over in the boundary box you will see a tooltip containing the  alternate category as well as the place name.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following into a new cell and name the cell <strong>places_visualised</strong>:</p>

<p>While we wait for the train station tooltips to materialize add a <strong>markdown cell</strong> above the cell we have just created. Markdown is useful to help tell a data story within the notebook. Hover above the newly created cell which is currently running and press  <strong>Markdown</strong>.  Name the cell <strong>cortex_description</strong> and paste the following narrative:</p>
<pre><code language="language-markdown" class="language-markdown">Below we are leveraging Mistral-large2 to produce meaningful tooltips relating to over **400** train stations which are managed by **Northern Trains**

<p>We used <strong>call_function</strong> to call Snowflake Cortex complete which returns a response that completes an input prompt.

<h2 is-upgraded>Running the App to generate data</h2>
<p>Within the App, generate events for various mp&#39;s.   You can decide how many you would like to generate.  Once  you have selected what you would like to generate, press Generate Reports.  This will create Incidents relating to the MP.  They will also be in the context of the specified activity.</p>
<p>Once you have generated events, select each MP under the Individual incidents section.  This will generate synthetic social media posts for the incidents.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/9307f083eab680fe.png"></p>
<p>Finally we will create a Streamlit app which adds this additional information to a map.</p>

        <p class="image-container"><img alt="assets" src="img/341ae171501a474b.png"></p>
<p>During the lab we have produced quite a bit of unstructured data from social media posts, to incidents, through to letters.  Now lets use vector embedding functionality to make this information searchable.  This is really useful when you would like to use an LLM to answer questions but do not want to send the entire dataset as a large object - which could be quite expensive and also would take a long time to run.  For large text blocks, you may wish to ‘chunk&#39; the data first.  As the text in this scenario is relatively small - we will keep it as is.  Once you have explored the principles of how text searching works, you will create a Cortex Search Service.</p>
