        <h2 is-upgraded>Snowflake Connection</h2>
<p>Now that we have our cloud environments setup, it is time to create the connection from ThoughtSpot to Snowflake. If you haven&#39;t done so already, go ahead and log into your ThoughtSpot account. From the top menu, select <strong>Data</strong>, then <strong>Connections</strong> from the left hand menu, tap <strong>Snowflake</strong>, give your connection the name <code>TutorialSnowStore</code>, and tap continue.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="ThoughtSpot to Snowflake" src="img/29d9308282da572e.gif"></p>
<p>After tapping <strong>Continue</strong>, you will be prompted to enter Snowflake connection details. These are the details you collected earlier from the Snowflake Free Trial. Copy these into the form, paying careful attention to case. Connection details are case sensitive and need to appear exactly as they appear in Snowflake.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Create a Worksheet in ThoughtSpot" duration="10">
        <p>Worksheet is a flat table representation exposed to business users, the goal is for business users to express questions on top of this worksheet without having to worry about the data schema hidden behind this simplistic definition. ThoughtSpot uses Worksheets, which are logical views of data, to model complex datasets. The Worksheets simplify access to data for end-users and application services by incorporating these key features, and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table joins supplement the primary data with information from various other data sources.</li>
<li>Changing data types ensures that you can handle mismatches gracefully, For example, conversions of date/time type formats, and processing of   numeric codes (such as event IDs) correctly.</li>
<li>Derived fields support flexible expressions and formulas.</li>
<li>Renamed fields make charts and tables easily accessible.</li>
<li>Selecting fields allows you to focus only on the fields that are necessary to the business use case.</li>
<li>Hiding fields lets you change the visibility of data by obscuring and securing sensitive information without affecting the calculations that depend on it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Steps to Create a Worksheet</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Create a Worksheet" src="img/d344323757659acb.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Select Data, on the top navigation bar.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>+ Create</strong> new button in the side navigation bar.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Worksheet</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Add Sources and Columns to a Worksheet</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Add Sources" src="img/8914ec3b1e5de3f7.png"></p>
<p>After creating a Worksheet, you need to add the sources that contain the data. A source is another name for a table. The sources you choose are typically related to one another by foreign keys.</p>
<p>To add sources to your Worksheet, follow these steps. The Worksheet creation UI also guides you through the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>+</strong> icon next to Sources.</li>
<li>Select the checkbox next to each of the sources you want to include in the Worksheet. You can search for specific Views or tables. You can also select every data source that has a specific tag, like <strong>Retail</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that the list of sources only shows the data sources on which you have view or edit privileges.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the Worksheet join rule. Either apply joins progressively or apply all joins. Applying joins progressively speeds up performance.</li>
<li>Select <strong>CLOSE</strong> to save your changes.</li>
<li>Expand the table names under <strong>Sources</strong> and select the columns to add to the Worksheet, by doing any of the following:<ul>
<li>To add all of the columns from a table, click the table name and select <strong>+ Add Columns</strong>.</li>
<li>To add a single column, double-click its name.</li>
<li>To add multiple columns, <code>Control</code> + click each column you want to add and select + Add Columns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that after you add a column, non-related tables (those without a primary/foreign key relationship) become hidden. If you are working with two tables that should be related, but are not, you can add a relationship between them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Select the more options icon, and select Save.</li>
<li>In the Save Worksheet window, enter a name and description for your Worksheet and select SAVE.</li>
</ul>

<li>Embed ThoughtSpot Analytics</li>
<li>Built with React and TypeScript</li>
<li>Fast development with Vite</li>
<li>Integration with Snowflake</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Get Started</h2>
<p>These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating" target="_blank">Node Version Mangager (nvm)</a><ul>
<li>Not sure if you have it installed? Run <code>nvm</code> or <code>nvm -v</code> at the command line and hit enter. If you hit a &#34;command not found&#34; error, you likely do not have it installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install Node (required to run the site locally) using nvm: <code>nvm install latest</code><ul>
<li>If you have Homebrew installed and don&#39;t want to use nvm, run: <code>brew install node</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine ensure you have access to ThoughtSpot and Snowflake accounts</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Installation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clone the repository: open a terminal window in VS Code or your favorite IDE and type in the following below</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">   git clone https://github.com/thoughtspot/snowflake-quickstart-tse

</code></pre>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>

</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Liveboard" src="img/d053bf85cdd0fda.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize the Data with LiveboardsFor many users, viewing data in charts is the most efficient way of analysing data. The trouble with most charting solutions is that the results is very static.Consider a traditional dashboard to view daily sales. Charts on these dashboards are effectively pre-defined queries. With ThoughtSpot however, charts and dashboards are fully dynamic; they are alive. You can modify the filters with natural language, tap and drill in to view deeper insights, and more.For this tutorial, we are going to create a Liveboard, a dynamic dashboard, to represent product sales by store.  Let&#39;s get started.From the top navigation, select <strong>Liveboards</strong>, then tap the <strong>+Liveboard</strong> button in the top right, and name your Liveboard <code>Snow - Store Sales</code>. Click <strong>Create</strong>. Your Liveboard is now available alongside any other Liveboards you may have in your environment. Go ahead and tap on <code>Snow - Store Sales</code> to open it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Liveboard1" src="img/9a6446989355da65.gif"></p>
