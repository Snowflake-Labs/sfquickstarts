      <google-codelab-step label="Overview" duration="10">
        <p>In this Quickstart guide, we will walk through how to use <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/container-runtime-ml" target="_blank">Container Runtime</a> in <a href="http://www.snowflake.com/ml" target="_blank">Snowflake ML</a> to perform Multi-Node, Multi-GPU audio transcription at limitless scale over multiple audio files.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Snowflake ML?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/" target="_blank">Snowflake ML</a> is the integrated set of capabilities for end-to-end machine learning in a single platform on top of your governed data. Data scientists and ML engineers can easily and securely develop and productionize scalable features and models without any data movement, silos or governance tradeoffs.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Container Runtime?</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/container-runtime-ml" target="_blank">Container Runtime</a> gives you a flexible container infrastructure that supports building and operationalizing a wide variety of resource-intensive ML workflows entirely within Snowflake.</p>
<p>Container Runtime is a set of preconfigured customizable environments built for machine learning on Snowpark Container Services, covering interactive experimentation and batch ML workloads such as model training, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference and fine tuning. They include the most popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks. Container Runtime also provides flexibility the ability to pip install any open-source package of choice.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime?</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs" target="_blank">Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime</a>  are a powerful IDE option for building ML models at scale in <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowflake-ml/" target="_blank">Snowflake ML</a>.</p>
<p>Snowflake Notebooks are natively built into Snowsight, and provide everything you need for interactive development, cell by cell execution of Python, Markdown and SQL code. By using Snowflake Notebooks one can increase the productivity since it simplifies connecting to the data and using popular OSS libraries for ML use cases. Notebooks on Container Runtime offer a robust environment with a comprehensive repository of pre-installed CPU and GPU machine learning packages and frameworks, significantly reducing the need for package management and dependency troubleshooting. This allows you to quickly get started with your preferred frameworks and even import models from external sources. Additionally, you can use pip to install any custom package as needed. The runtime also features an optimized data ingestion layer and provides a set of powerful APIs for training and hyperparameter tuning. These APIs extend popular ML packages, enabling you to train models efficiently within Snowflake. At the core of this solution is a Ray-powered distributed compute cluster, giving you seamless access to both CPU and GPU resources. This ensures high performance and optimal infrastructure usage without the need for complex setup or configuration, allowing you to focus solely on your machine learning workloads.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed Environment: Focus on your ML projects without the overhead of managing underlying infrastructure.</li>
<li>Scalability: Leverage distributed computing resources to efficiently handle large datasets and complex computations.</li>
<li>Integration: Seamlessly combine with Snowflake&#39;s ML operations for a cohesive workflow.</li>
<li>Flexibility: While common ML packages come pre-installed, you have the option to install custom packages as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 is-upgraded>What is Container Runtime&#39;s architecture?</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="ContainerRuntime Architecture" src="img/e2dae559302f925c.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What APIs does Container Runtime have to support Unstructured Data Processing?</h2>
<p>Container Runtime for ML provides several APIs to handle unstructured data, such as images, text and binary files, from Snowflake Stage and process it in Snowflake&#39;s Container Runtime using <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html" target="_blank">Ray Data</a>. These APIs enable efficient unstructured data processing and analysis without the need for complex data movement or transformation. At the time of writing this quickstart, Container Runtime for ML has the following APIs for handling unstructured data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reading into Snowflake: <ol type="1">
<li>SFStageImageDatasource - This class allows us to load images from Snowflake Stage and pass them forward for distributed processing with Container Runtime for ML.</li>
<li>SFStageTextDatasource - This class allows us to load text from Snowflake Stage and use them in downstream distributed calls.</li>
<li>SFStageBinaryFileDataSource - This class allows us to read content from Snowflake stage as binary files and use them in downstream processors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Writing to Snowflake: <ol type="1">
<li>SnowflakeTableDatasink - This class provides snowflake specific <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/doc/ray.data.Datasink.html" target="_blank">Ray data sink APIs</a> to allow customers write the processed dataset into a snowflake table</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this quickstart, we will be using SFStageBinaryFileDataSource and SnowflakeTableDatasink class.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What model are we using for audio transcription?</h2>
<p>Whisper is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation, proposed in the paper <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.04356" target="_blank">Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision</a> by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. Trained on &gt;5M hours of labeled data, Whisper demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains in a zero-shot setting.</p>
<p>Whisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large" target="_blank">large</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2" target="_blank">large-v2</a> models, except for the following minor differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The spectrogram input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80</li>
<li>A new language token for Cantonese</li>
</ol>
<p>See details here for the <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3" target="_blank">model</a></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Value Proposition" duration="5">
        <p>Snowflake ML Container Runtime offers significant value for distributed multi-node, multi-GPU audio transcription. Here are the key benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Powerful Models</strong>: Utilizes state-of-the-art models like Whisper for accurate audio transcription.</p>
<p><strong>GPU Acceleration</strong>: Supports GPU machine types for faster processing, demonstrated by the example using 5 GPU_NV_S nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: The demo processed approximately 2700 audio files in just 2 minutes using 5 Small GPU nodes on AWS (specifically GPU_NV_S compute family), each costing 0.57 credits/hour. The cost is derived from the Credit Consumption Table 1 (d) highlighted <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Minimal Credit Consumption</strong>: This resulted in a very low cost of only (2/60) * 0.57 = 0.019 credits per node, so 0.095 credits for 5 nodes or $0.285 to transcribe 2700 audio files (based on $3 per credit).</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: Rapid transcription of a large number of files, significantly reducing processing time.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Handles large datasets and complex computations efficiently using distributed computing resources.</p>
<p><strong>Managed Environment</strong>: Eliminates the overhead of managing underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on ML projects. Integration: Seamlessly combines with Snowflake&#39;s ML operations for a cohesive workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Pre-installed common ML packages with the option to install custom packages as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Unstructured Data Processing</strong>: APIs like SFStageBinaryFileDataSource and SnowflakeTableDatasink enable efficient handling of audio files from Snowflake Stage.</p>
