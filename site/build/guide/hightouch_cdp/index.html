        <p>Too often, marketers have limited access to their data. They must submit ad-hoc requests to data teams, rely on analysts to provide customer insights, and sporadically collect and upload manual customer list CSVs into their marketing and advertising platforms.</p>
<p>In this Quickstart, Snowflake and Hightouch will walk you through how to equip your business teams with powerful self-serve tools that transform Snowflake into a marketing engine that drives growth for your business.</p>
<p>Using Hightouch, data teams from leading enterprises enable their marketing teams to independently improve campaign conversion, deliver captivating personalized customer experiences, and accelerate their marketing efforts - all with the power of the Marketing Data Cloud.</p>
<p>Hightouch offers teams the ability to implement a Composable Customer Data Platform. The product has all the features needed to transform Snowflake into a marketing-friendly platform that drives growth.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Hightouch Overview" src="img/a9f317db6a84b731.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You Will Learn</h2>
<p>This Quickstart is for both business teams and data teams but will focus on how data teams can set up visual UIs for their business teams to use. You&#39;ll be hands-on with a semantic layer, audience builder, and analytics suite, with the end goal of taking home a demo that should excite both your data and marketing teams.</p>
<p>At the end of this Quickstart, you will successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn Snowflake into a Composable CDP that your marketing team can self-serve.</li>
<li>Set up a self-serve audience builder that is fully customized to match your custom schema within Snowflake.</li>
<li>Create a split test to measure the impact of a marketing campaign on key business metrics.</li>
<li>Analyze the results of your split test with a suite of no-code analytics tools that pull insight directly from Snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: To complete this quickstart, you must have access to the advanced features of Hightouch. If completing outside of Snowflake hands-on labs, please reach out to the Hightouch team to get access.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Snowflake Account</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need a Snowflake Account with ACCOUTADMIN access to install Hightouch via Partner Connect. If you don&#39;t have the correct permissions, you&#39;ll need to start a trial account, which the next section details.</p>

        <p>Schemas define the data Hightouch should read from in Snowflake. Think about this as setting up your semantic layer with a visual ERD in Hightouch. Once you&#39;ve set up your schema, which is a one-time setup*, you and your marketing team can build thousands of audiences with just a small set of initial models and events.</p>
<p>By following along with the setup in this section, you&#39;ll learn how to create a simple schema like this that ties users to Purchase, Add to Carts, and Product View events.</p>

<li>Next, we need to define the columns from our Snowflake table that we would like to sync to Facebook Custom Audiences ID fields.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To do so, click &#34;Add Mapping&#34; and select &#34;Email&#34; from the dropdown.</li>
<li>Next, click the associated Facebook field - in this case, Email.</li>
<li>Proceed by mapping phone, first_name, last_name, city, and state. Remember, the more fields that you add, the higher the match rate - increasing the probability of Facebook matching users to your audience.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Sync Creation - Map Fields" src="img/a4adf55ec74ca8e0.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>Under the field hashing setting, choose &#34;YES&#34; to allow Hightouch to hash values since the data is not hashed yet.</li>
<li>Leave the Shared Audience section blank.</li>
<li>Choose to Remove the Facebook Custom Audiences record from the specified audience - this ensures that as users fall out of our audience criteria, they are removed from the Facebook audience.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Continue.&#34;</li>
<li>Optionally, enter a description for the sync. In this case, you can leave it blank.</li>
<li>Finally, select the schedule on which you would like this sync to run. Hightouch offers a number of different sync scheduling options to meet your various needs. In this case, we will select the schedule type of &#34;Interval&#34; and then choose an interval of &#34;Every 1 Hour(s).&#34;</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Sync Creation - Choose Interval" src="img/88f877c83ea2961b.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>Click &#34;Finish.&#34; Your sync will now Run for the first time. All records that fit the audience criteria will be sent to the Facebook destination along with the specific fields we mapped in the earlier steps.</li>
<li>With the audience sync in place, you can additionally QA the sync, set up alerting, monitor activity, set up sync logs (writing the audience back to Snowflake), and edit any settings for future syncs. In this case, we will simply continue.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a Sync Template</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, while the flexibility is great for configuring each setting of your sync, managing many audiences can become tedious. Hightouch&#39;s sync templates allow marketers to set up syncs with just one click.</p>
<p>Sync templates let you define sync configuration settings once for a particular destination. You create the sync template and then use it to add syncs for each audience requiring the same configuration settings and schedule.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate back to &#34;Schema&#34; within the Customer Studio tab.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Settings&#34; and go to the Sync Templates tab.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Sync Templates - Add Template" src="img/5671380707b05d35.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Click &#34;Add Sync Template&#34; to launch the template creation flow.</li>
<li>Select your existing User parent model.</li>
<li>Select your existing Facebook destination.</li>
<li>Configure your sync as you would typically: create your specific field mappings (see below) and make sure to toggle on &#34;Remove the Facebook Custom Audiences record from the specified audience.&#34;</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Sync Template - Configure Sync" src="img/2928a535f1ccfd15.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="7">
<li>Click &#34;Continue&#34; and select an hourly interval as your sync schedule.</li>
<li>Optionally enter a template name - in this case, you can leave as-is.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Finish&#34;, and that&#39;s it! Your marketing team can now use this sync template for any future audience syncs.</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Customer Studio - Splits" duration="10">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Experiment with Splits</h2>
<p>As a marketer gearing up for your next campaign, you&#39;re likely thinking about critical questions like &#34;Which channel should I leverage?&#34; or &#34;What copy or offer will resonate best?&#34; The key to unlocking these answers lies in continuous testing and iteration.</p>
<p>Hightouch&#39;s Splits feature powers rapid A/B and multivariate testing. With Splits, Hightouch segments your audience(s) into randomized groups across your channels and writes the segments back to Snowflake to streamline experimentation and analysis.</p>
<p>You can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of splits you want to use.</li>
<li>The percentage of the total audience membership that each split should have; for example, split A gets 40%, and split B gets 60%.</li>
<li>The destination to send each split to; for example, split A goes to Facebook, Split B goes to Google, and split C is a holdout that doesn&#39;t get sent to any destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Splits, you can run experiments such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holdout Tests: Send one split to a marketing destination (email, Google, Facebook, etc.) and have the other split act as a control and receive no messaging. These tests use the holdout group feature and can prove if there was an actual lift from marketing efforts.</li>
<li>Channel Tests: Send splits to different channels to determine the most effective one.</li>
<li>Offer/Creative Tests: Deploy different messaging on each split to see what resonates the best.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>To create a split, we will first create another audience by clicking into Audiences in the Customer Studio tab and then clicking <strong>Add Audience</strong>.</li>
<li>Select your Users parent model.</li>
<li>Create a cart abandon audience.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Click &#34;Add Filter&#34; and select the event Added to Cart.</li>
<li>Add a time window to only include users who added to cart in prev 30 days.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Then Performed&#34; and Toggle &#34;Then Performed&#34; to &#34;Then did not Perform.&#34;</li>
<li>Select &#34;Purchased&#34; as the field within Then did not Perform.</li>
<li>Add a time window of 7 days of Added to Cart.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Splits - Cart Abandon" src="img/71d9e1220840f78.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>With your logic defined, you can Click &#34;Show Insights&#34; and use the Overlap tab to see the overlap of this new audience with your Purchaser audience by selecting it from the dropdown.</li>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="Splits - Show Insights" src="img/9655c31ebc4f46b4.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Once you check the overlap, click &#34;Continue.&#34;</li>
<li>Name the audience &#34;Cart Abandoners p30d [Your First Initial and Company Name]&#34; and optionally add a description.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Finish.&#34;</li>
<li>With the audience now created, click the &#34;Splits&#34; tab within the Cart Abandoners audience.</li>
<li>Toggle to Enable Split Groups.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Splits - Split Groups" src="img/aef234b857ff8ea4.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="10">
<li>You can now choose how many splits you would like Hightouch to randomly create within your audience, the weighting that each split should be, and the destinations that each split should be sent to - users in holdout groups will only be synced into a Snowflake table so that you have a control group to analyze lift against. For now, leave the splits as-is at 80/20 between the treatment and control. Click save changes.</li>
<li>Click the &#34;+ Add sync&#34; within the Splits window to create a sync for the split group.</li>
<li>Select the Facebook sync template you created in the previous section and click &#34;Add Syncs.&#34;</li>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Analyze data with Campaign Intelligence</h2>
<p>No matter how great your ideas are, marketing success hinges on your ability to try new things, understand what&#39;s working, and iterate quickly. Unfortunately, understanding what&#39;s working is a massive challenge today for most teams. They struggle to analyze performance across channels and data silos, are often stuck with basic metrics, and have to rely on technical teams for deeper insights.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightouch.com/blog/announcing-campaign-intelligence#getting-started" target="_blank">Campaign Intelligence</a> tackles these challenges head-on. It gives marketers an easy, self-service platform for marketing analytics on top of their complete campaign and customer data in Snowflake.
