        <p>Does your organization have data intelligence? Can people easily find, understand, and trust data? If not, you&#39;ll want to join this lab to learn how Alation ensures people have reliable and trustworthy data to make confident, data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>In this expert-led, hands-on lab, you will follow a step-by-step guide utilizing an Alation-provided sample database of a fictitious TV streaming company, Juno. Using this example data, you will learn how the Alation Data Catalog improves productivity with self-service analytics and uses automation and continuous improvement to manage data governance. See why Alation is Snowflake&#39;s <em>3-time Data Governance Partner of the Year</em>.</p>
<p>During the lab, you&#39;ll kickstart your 14-day free trial of Alation — to which you can connect to your own Snowflake environment and continue to explore the data catalog.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>One of the best parts of using the Alation Data Intelligence Platform is that you get a system to drive a data culture and a wealth of knowledge on how to get started. Data Governance doesn&#39;t need to be a daunting undertaking. Let Alation help guide you using an active data governance methodology based on people first.</p>
<p>This section is all about how to get started and achieve value quickly from Alation—starting with curating assets to understanding common problems that most data organizations want to solve. Some challenges impact a particular role in an organization, and you will see how <strong>all roles</strong> benefit from the data intelligence platform solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that we will be accessing an Alation-provided Snowflake account for this lab. At the conclusion of the lab, we&#39;ll discuss how to set up Alation to manage your own Snowflake data sources.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Identifying Policies" duration="10">
        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In today&#39;s world of data management, it is common to have policies and procedures that range from data quality and retention to personal data protection. If you are an organization that has policies defined, how difficult is it to find them? Often, policies are in file shares or document systems, making them very hard to discover. With Alation, you can store your policies where your data assets live, which makes them extremely easy to find. The other huge benefit is that data assets associated with the policy can be tracked.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the rich cataloging and governance capabilities, the Alation Data Intelligence Platform enables users to interact with data stored in cataloged sources. This capability is called Compose and provides a fully integrated and governed SQL development environment.</p>
<p>Compose is more than your typical SQL editor. Because it is integrated with the active metadata stored in the catalog, the editor&#39;s IntelliSense can provide suggestions as you type for tables, columns, joins, etc. Another advantage is that active data governance will show you when an item is deprecated, so you are not using bad data.</p>
<p>Queries can be developed by those who know SQL and shared with others in the organization. No worries if you don&#39;t know how to read or write SQL. Queries can be published as forms, allowing the business user to fill out some prompts and get answers to the questions they need answered.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Data quality is a critical data management function that helps identify issues based on the rules defined and executed against the data. Thresholds can be set to help guide users on whether using the data is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>Alation provides extensive data quality capabilities through its Open Data Quality Framework. Snowflake provides data quality features through Data Metric Functions (DMFs). The two integrated provide people with the health of the data at the point of consumption. Additional data quality policies provide the details of the data quality rule, thresholds for good, warning, and alert conditions, the data assets processed by the rule, and more.</p>
<p>When the stakes are high, especially when providing data for AI models, data quality is a must!</p>
