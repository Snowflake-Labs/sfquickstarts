        <p>In this guide, you&#39;ll learn how to securely provision data access using <strong>Immuta</strong> and <strong>Snowflake</strong> by stepping into the roles of a <strong>Data Consumer</strong>, <strong>Data Product Owner</strong>, and <strong>Data Governor</strong>.</p>
<p>The scenario centers on a <strong>healthcare</strong> dataset containing <strong>patient and provider encounters</strong> across a network of facilities. You&#39;ll use an HLS dataset to simulate a federated enterprise environment and experience how Immuta helps organizations streamline access while maintaining compliance and accelerating time to data.</p>
<p>By the end of the guide, you&#39;ll have published a secure data product, enforced dynamic policies, and accessed governed data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Introduction to Immuta</h2>
<p>AI and other technologies have created a surge in data demand, with 10–100x more consumers needing access. While data is now easier for non-technical users to reach, the governance processes haven&#39;t scaled. As a result, IT and data teams are overwhelmed, and users are frustrated by delays. <img alt="funnel" src="img/a8afedeb341e225e.png"></p>
<p>Despite the push to make data more accessible, most organizations still rely on a complex, manual process involving multiple teams. From request to access, it often takes over two months—slowing down insights and frustrating users. This model no longer scales with modern data demands. <img alt="people" src="img/f219ff1e56cad2a9.png"></p>
<p>Immuta simplifies and secures the data access process with a single platform that combines a governed data marketplace with automated policy enforcement. Data consumers get fast, compliant access, while stewards, governors, and product owners work within clear, auditable workflows <img alt="dg" src="img/c2f057569a64a3f7.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>You&#39;ve been provisioned with an <strong>Okta profile</strong> that will allow you to seamlessly sign in to the following environments for the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immuta Governance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Immuta Marketplace</strong></li>
<li><strong>Snowflake Workshop Account</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In Snowflake, you&#39;re provisioned as a data owner over a single schema within a domain-scoped database. Throughout this workshop, you&#39;ll create fine-grained access controls to govern this data and publish a secure data product that others can request through the Immuta Marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to use the shared Snowflake worksheet provided for the hands-on exercises.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Okta</li>
<li>Launch each application: <ul>
<li>Immuta Governance</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Data Governor Experience" duration="15">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>Domains in Immuta enable decentralized, federated governance by giving business units control over their own policies while still enforcing organization-wide rules through a global policy layer. Each domain contains its own data sources, governance rules, and designated stewards who manage access and ensure compliance. In this lab, you&#39;ll operate as a domain steward, managing access and policies within your domain, while global compliance is enforced through shared metadata across the platform, ensuring consistency in a distributed model.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="domains" src="img/f2d5fabb6b533ec7.png"></p>
<p>Subscription policies determine who can see a dataset, while data policies govern how sensitive information is masked or filtered based on context, ensuring secure, compliant access. Immuta policies offer fine-grained control over data access at every level: table, column, row, and even individual cells.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="subpolicy" src="img/5a44c06cfe412119.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll do</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are <strong>Greg the Domain Governor</strong> who is responsible for ensuring that all the data within his domain is secured based on global compliance standards and inter domain requirements.</li>
<li>You need to build a policy that will include global masking requirements based on data metadata (tags) that are being automatically applied by Immuta.  This masking policy must also include a domain requirement to mask ‘location&#39; data.</li>
<li>We&#39;ll start by looking at the Patient table within the Immuta Governance application so we can confirm automated data discovery tags were applied.</li>
<li>Then you&#39;ll create a domain specific data policy within the Immuta Governance application using the metadata tags available to secure location information.</li>
