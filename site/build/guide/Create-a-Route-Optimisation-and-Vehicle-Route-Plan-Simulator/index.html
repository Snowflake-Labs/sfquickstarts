<p>In this quickstart, we will be leveraging the the tools within Snowflake to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualize</strong> the location of Delivery Points anywhere in the world understand the best routes for vehicles to deliver goods or services from a designated depo. We will use the multi layer mapping capabilities of pydeck to create easy to understand routing plans</li>
<li><strong>Discover</strong> what it would look like to route goods to real world points of interest such as restaurants or supermarkets using the Overture Point of Interest dataset provided freely on the marketplace by Carto.</li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> numerous routing scenarios across a variety of industries anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would prefer to skip to quickly see how the route optimization service might work for you, you can quickly use the <strong>free api service</strong> using the instructions as option 2 for creating the functions.</p>
<p>You will be leveraging <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" target="_blank">Open Route Service</a> to optimize vehicle routes in order to distribute goods to chosen destinations on time.</p>
<p>You will be creating <strong>Directions</strong>, <strong>Route Optimization</strong> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map" target="_blank"><strong>Isochrone</strong></a> functions.</p>
<p>The quickstart contains two options.  Both options require distinct prerequisites.  With either option, Snowflake allows for creation of a fully interactive route simulator which will benefit many vehicle centric industries such as <strong>retail</strong>, <strong>distribution</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong> and more.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong> Use Snowpark Containers with a native app using the Open Route Service</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Route Planning And Optimization Architecture</h2>
<p>The architecture below shows the solution which uses a native app and container services to power sophisticated routing and optimisation functions.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/30222fdaa75bb765.png"></p>
<p>This is a self contained service which is managed by you.  There are no api calls outside of snowflake and no api limitations.  This quickstart uses a medium CPU pool which is capable of running unlimited service calls within <strong>New York City</strong>.  if you wish to use a larger map such as Europe or the World, you can increase the size of the compute.</p>
<p><strong>This is what you will need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration" target="_blank">External Access Integration Activated</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> - External Access Integration is enabled by default with the exception of Free Trials where you would need to contact your snowflake representative to activate it.  You will need this to securely download the map and config files from the provider account.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview" target="_blank">Snowpark Container Services Activated</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> This is enabled by default with the exception of Free Trials where you would need to contact your snowflake representative to activate it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACCOUNTADMIN</strong> access to the account.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop</a> installed</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index" target="_blank">Snowflake CLI</a> installed</li>
<li>(Recommended) <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> installed.</li>
<li>Either download the zip or use git to copy the contents of the the git repo here: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-create-a-route-optimisation-and-vehicle-route-plan-simulator.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSCode</a> with the Snowflake extension installed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong> Use External Access Integration with Python Functions to call and retrieve data from the Open Route Service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/5f834b61e73d8a48.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>You will need access to a Snowflake Account</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration" target="_blank">External Access Integration</a> NB - External Access Integration is enabled by default with the exception of Free Trials where you would need to contact your snowflake representative to activate it.  This is for connecting to the open route service api.</li>
<li>An free account with <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" target="_blank">Open Route Service</a></li>
<li><strong>ACCOUNTADMIN</strong> access to the account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>A more advanced understanding of <strong>Geospatial</strong> data in Snowflake</li>
<li>Using <strong>AISQL</strong> functions with Snowpark</li>
<li>Create 3 user defined functions which either call the open route service API or you will learn how to create the service in snowflake using a snowpark container services native app.</li>
<li>create simple and multi waypoint directions point to point functions based on the road network and vehicle profile</li>
<li>Route Optimization to match the demands with vehicle availability</li>
<li>Create an isochrone for catchment analysis</li>
<li>Creating a location centric application using Streamlit</li>

<li>Leverage vehicle capabilities and matching with job specifics</li>
<li>use a real dataset to simulate route plans for a specific depot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Build</h2>
<ul>
<li>A streamlit application to simulate route plans for potential customers anywhere in the world.  This could be for a potential new depot or simply to try out route optimisation which you will later replace with a real data pipeline.</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Option 1 - Native app &amp; SPCS" duration="30">
        <p><img alt="alt text" src="img/30222fdaa75bb765.png"> Use Snowpark Containers with a native app using the Open Route Service</p>
<p>This will create the necessary snowflake database and stages within the public schema.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up visual studio code with the downloaded github repository as per the prerequisites.</li>
<li>Use the Snowflake <strong>add-in</strong> to login to your snowflake account</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/fde64c9557e82a5c.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Within the Repo, navigate to:<strong>Native_app</strong> &gt; <strong>Provider_setup</strong> &gt;  <strong>env_setup.sql</strong></li>
<li>Press run all or ctrl + enter / command + enter to run the code within visual studio code.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will now have a database which contains an empty repository and three stages.  You can view these stages easily with the VSCode addin.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/85ca86d1f3583991.png"></p>
<p>The  <strong>ORS_SPCS_STAGE</strong> stage will contain a map extract and a config file.</p>
<p>The <strong>ORS_GRAPHS_SPCS_STAGE</strong> stage will contain files in a graphs structure to easily calculate route optimisations.  The graphs created will depend on the map uploaded and which vehicle profiles are enabled.</p>
<p>The <strong>ORS_ELEVATION_CACHE_SPCS_STAGE</strong>.</p>
<p>This cache stores elevation data based on the chosen map extract.  This improves performance when enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the folder <strong>Provider_setup &gt; staged files</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In here you will see two files.  One of which is a map file.</p>
<p>An example map file you can use is of San Francisco which is provided in the staged_files folder.  To use this file, it needs to be uploaded to the <strong>ORS_SPCS_STAGE</strong>.  You can do this either manually within snowsight, or more conveniently, using the snowflake add-in.</p>
<p>You can choose from a range of map files from websites such as these</p>
<p>https://download.geofabrik.de/ https://download.bbbike.org/osm/</p>
<p>The file below is the original weekly updated open street map which contains the whole planet. https://planet.openstreetmap.org/pbf/</p>
<p>Bear in mind the bigger the map, the longer it will take to create the graphs.  You may also require a larger compute for the container to run if you are using a larger map. You might also need to update parameter XMX (Max RAM assigned to Java) in file <code>services/openrouteservice/openrouteservice.yaml</code>. As a Rule of Thumb, set it to: <code><PBF-size> * <profiles> * 2</code></p>
<p>Also please note that the size of the files uploaded using the put command is limited to 5G.  If you wish to use the world file, you will need to initially store in a cloud storage like S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage and then copy using the copy command.</p>
<p>The ors-config file is a configuration file for the app.  This does a variety of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up the ors-config.yml file to take a look at it</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see at the beginning of the yml file is a source file locator.</p>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">ors:
  engine:
    profile_default:
      build:  
        source_file: /home/ors/files/sanFrancisco.osm.pbf

</code></pre>
<p>This is what the URL will be to point to the right map file.   If you would like to use a different map, as well as uploading the alternative map you will need to change the source file parameter here.</p>
<p>Next you will see a profiles configuration area</p>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">    profiles:
      driving-car:
        enabled: true
      cycling-road:
        enabled: true
      driving-hgv:
        enabled: true
</code></pre>
<p>This is where you can configure multiple types of vehicles.  If you look at the commented out profiles in here, you can also  configure each profile further as well as adding additional profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>edit the config yml file and add <strong>cycling-electric</strong> and <strong>foot-walking</strong> profiles:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">    profiles:
      driving-car:
        enabled: true
      cycling-road:
        enabled: true
      driving-hgv:
        enabled: true
      cycling-electric:
        enabled: true
      foot-walking:
        enabled: true
</code></pre>
<p>Here is where you can change the amount of maximum visited nodes.</p>
<p>The nodes are locations where route optimization algorithms are implemented and processed. These nodes are crucial for efficiently planning and executing delivery or service routes, minimizing travel time and cost.  The number of nodes required will depend on how many vehicles, what the vehicle profile is, the length of each journey and how many jobs are involved.  Here, the default number of visited nodes are much lower than the overridden default below. Same for maximum_routes.</p>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">    matrix:
      maximum_visited_nodes: 1000000000
      maximum_routes: 25000000
</code></pre>
<p>There are also other options available for each profile - and each option will depend on what the profile is.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Importing new files into a stage using the Snowflake Add-In.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download a new map file for <strong>new york city</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/NewYork/NewYork.osm.pbf" target="_blank">here</a> to download the New York City OSM.PBF file.</li>
<li>Within the snowflake add-in navigate to the newly created <strong>ORS_SPCS_STAGE</strong>.   You will see this in the <strong>Object Explorer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/6871e7a9b707784b.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the upload icon - <img alt="alt text" src="img/dbb6d25fa9d4abf9.png"></li>
</ul>
<p>Navigate to the newly <strong>downloaded New York</strong> file to upload the map file to the snowflake stage.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/69039ab9d2129508.png"></p>
<p>Modify the <strong>config file</strong> by changing the source file location to the following:</p>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">    build:  
        source_file: /home/ors/files/NewYork.osm.pbf
        instructions: false
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, use the upload tool again to upload the modified config file to snowflake.</p>
<p>You should see the new files appear in th stages area</p>
<p>Once the files are uploaded, refresh the cache of the stage</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">ALTER STAGE OPENROUTESERVICE_SETUP.PUBLIC.ORS_SPCS_STAGE REFRESH;
</code></pre>
<p>Execute the following to ensure the files are registered on the stage directory</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql"> select * from directory(@OPENROUTESERVICE_SETUP.PUBLIC.ORS_SPCS_STAGE);

</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/9e2022b97c6c5c6d.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create the image and services.</h2>
<p>You will now load the docker images to the snowflake repository</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the provider_setup &gt; spcs_setup.sh and openn the file.</li>
<li>Amend where it says <strong>YOUR_CONNECTION</strong> with your <strong>snowcli</strong> connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  If you have not created a connection before, please navigate to the following <a href="https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting-started-with-snowflake-cli/index.html#0" target="_blank">QuickStart</a> before proceeding which will explain how these are created.</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute the following to ensure you have the correct privileges to run the bash file.  Open up a terminal from the <strong>/native_app</strong> directory within vscode and run the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">chmod +x provider_setup/spcs_setup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Run the <strong>spcs_setup.sh</strong> file.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">./provider_setup/spcs_setup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>You will need to ensure that you have docker desktop running before you run the file.</p>
<p>You now have an 4 docker images inside the previously created repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the env_setup.sql, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">SHOW IMAGES IN IMAGE REPOSITORY IMAGE_REPOSITORY;
</code></pre>
<p>You should see four images pushed to the image repository like this:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/8f5d68f21640393e.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>downloader</strong> image will copy the config and map file from the setup stage to the consumer app.</p>
<p>The <strong>routing_reverse_proxy</strong> will securely manage traffic between  the other three services.</p>
<p>The <strong>openrouteservice</strong> contains all the apis which the openrouteservice offers</p>
<p>The <strong>vroom service</strong> manages the route optimization service.</p>
<p>Now the assets are all setup in the repository and stages, you will now configure the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the same terminal in the same directory as before, execute the following snow CLI command</li>
</ul>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">snow app run -c &lt;CONNECTION_NAME&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will do the following:</p>
<p><strong>The Manifest File</strong> use the manifest file to compile to package all 4 images stored inside the image repository</p>
<p>Allow permissions for the consumer to create pools for running services.</p>
<p>Specify the default streamlit for configuring the app.</p>
<p><strong>The setup script</strong></p>
<p>When a consumer installs the app, it will add all the services for each image and create all objects needed to run the application.</p>
<p>This also includes the functions that we will later use in streamlit.  The following functions are created:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directions</li>
<li>Isochrones</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also note that an additional function (download) is created which calls the downloader service to download the map and config file from the provider stage to the consumer stage.</p>
<p>Once you application package is installed, you will see a new installed app appear in the <strong>apps</strong> section of Snowsight.  This is a locally installed app for testing purposes.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/4670589c65db6830.png"></p>
<p>You will also see an application package which you can use to share with other accounts either privately or via the marketplace.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Activate the app</h2>
<p>If you login to snow sight you will see the following newly created app within <strong>Data Products &gt; Apps</strong>.  This is an app local to this snowflake for testing purposes.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/c013908ddc056165.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the app and grant the permissions as requested by the application.  Once granted, you can then press <strong>Activate</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to wait a few minutes for the graphs to update.  Within the graphs stage you should see the following folders appear:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/b34656ed20ebebf2.png"></p>
<p>NB: you may need to refresh the stages to view the profiles. in the directory.</p>
<p>If you open the functions part of the app you will see the following functions appear</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/543f30d0be47db7f.png"></p>
<p>You will learn how to use these functions after option 2 of the quickstart which produces the same functions using rest api calls to the external service.  If you wish, skip option 2 and navigate to the Snowflake Marketplace section.  You will need a dataset provided by <strong>Carto</strong> on the market place for the part of the notebook and the streamlit to run.</p>

<p>The streamlit app which you have open simulates potential routes to 29 delivery locations for selected customer types - all coming from a user definable wholesaler.  Currently there are 3 types of distributor available although with the notebook, you can create limitless industry categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Cosmetics</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to add additional choice of distributor types, you can with the provided notebook.</p>
<p>Before you choose your category, you must select where the routing specific functions are.  This app works with both the api call method and the native app method.  If you followed the instructions and went through both options, you can test out either option using the supplied radio selector.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/80a600b96302cd54.png"></p>
<p>The places you will work with are real as they are based on the Carto Overture points of interest maps which is a dataset freely available on the marketplace.  This allows you to create a location relevant scenario based on the needs of a specific usecase.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong>  For this simulation the data has been restricted to new york city.  You will need to revise the initial notebook should you require an additional location.  This is an extract filtered by <strong>GEOHASH</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have built the native app and require an alternative city, you will need to upload the new map to the configuration stage.</p>

<li>Choose the LLM model in order to search for a location.</li>
<li>Type in a word or phrase in the world which will help locate the simulation.<br><strong>NB</strong> You will only return results in the New York City boundary.</li>
<li>Choose the distance in KM for how wide you would like the app to search for nearby distributors.<img alt="alt text" src="img/66e8c59d6cc1b9b2.png"></li>
<li>Scroll down to get a map which highlights the place plus where all the nearby distributors are.</li>
<li>Scroll further down in the sidebar to select a specific distributor. - This is sorted by distance from the centre point.  You should have relevent wholesalers based on location and industry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/829de3d0517411a3.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the type of customers you want to deliver goods to.  In this case, we are choosing supermarkets and restaurants.  Customer types can be configured using the provided notebook.</li>
<li>There is an order acceptance catchment time - this will be used to generate an isochrone which will filter possible delivery locations within that isochrone.  The isochrone produced is a polygon shaped to all the possible places you can drive within the acceptable drive time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 is-upgraded>Wholesaler Routing Walkthrough.</h2>
<p>This is an example scenario based on the previously selected fields.</p>
<p><strong>Hudson Produce</strong> is in New York City.  This week they have 3 vehicles assigned to make up to 30 deliveries today.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/73304fed78fa3933.png"></p>
<p><strong>Vehicle 1</strong> will start between 8HRS and 17HRS - this vehicle is a car.  [hover over information]  the vehicle has a capacity limit of 4 and been assigned a skill level of 1 - this vehicle does not have a freezer so can only carry fresh food.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle 2</strong> will operate between 12 and 17hrs [change vehicle 2 from 8 till 12].  This will also be a car but has a skill level of 2 which means they can deliver frozen food.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle 3</strong> will also operate between 8hrs and 17hrs and has a skill level of 3 - they can carry  the premium food items - this vehicle will be an road bicycle [select cycling-road].</p>
<p>You can look at the vehicle skill level by hovering over the ‘?&#39; against each vehicle.</p>
<p>Once the selections are made you can choose the scope for the jobs - this is based on a catchment time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select 25mins based on how far you can cycle in that time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/e2849f646707daf4.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/3adfb8fabe29c31.png"></p>
<p>You will note that orders of the Non Perishable orders will only go to vehicle 3, the fresh food will go to vehicle 2 and the frozen food will go to vehicle 1.</p>
<p>(if i have more vehicles that have the same skills it will also look at the time slots as well).</p>
<p>Next we look at the map</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/74632a242dcc3722.png"></p>
<p>Vehicle 3 has the least amount of things to deliver but takes the longest to deliver them.  This is probably because the vehicle is a bicycle.  [change bicycle to hgv and re run]</p>
<p>When looking at the map itself, you will see the lines of the route for each vehicle, this is colour coded - you will also see circles which also represent the drops for each vehicle.  The hoverover will tell you what the point represents.</p>
<p>Tabs - this will give instructions for each segment of the drivers journey - the final stop is the return back to the wholesaler.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt text" src="img/e7448ab62ba9ef17.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>How does it work</h2>
<p>You can see that in a couple of clicks you can create a vehicle optimisation scenario from anywhere.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Finding the place</h3>
<p>the app is using an LLM to retrieve a Latitude and longitude based on the word entered into the search.</p>
<p>Snowflake will use the ST_DWITHIN geospatial function to filter the overture maps to find all places of interest within an Xkm radius.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>The previously run notebook</h3>
<p>The previously ran notebook contains the standing data which you can go back to to customize the demo.  If you want to change the types of places to be hotels, then that is quite possible.</p>
<p>Within the notebook, you have also created:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overture dataset and included optimisation on geo and the category variant column to help with faster searching.</li>
<li>An industry lookup table to add relevant context</li>
<li>A job sample table</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>The mapping</h3>
<p>The solution leverages Pydeck to plot points, linestrings and polygons on a map.  The isochrone is the polygon, the routes are linestrings and the places/points of interest are points.  You would have seen how this works in the original notebook. AISQL is useful to quickly generate python code to test the maps.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="The Streamlit Code" duration="10">
        <p>This final Section, gives you some explanation as to how the streamlit code works.</p>
<p>The Streamlit puts all of the above components together. I will now explain how the main aspects of the code works.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Theming</strong></p>
<p>An important feature for better user experience is what the application looks like. I have themed the app to be consistant with Snowflake Branding. This is so much easier and flexible now we can add styles to Streamlit in Snowflake.</p>
<p>For the theming, a style sheet was added to the streamlit project.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">with open(&#39;extra.css&#39;) as f:
    st.markdown(f&#34;&lt;style&gt;{f.read()}&lt;/style&gt;&#34;, unsafe_allow_html=True)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Industry Lookup</strong></p>
<p>An  industry lookup snowpark dataframe is created. We then create a second dataframe which only selects the industry name. This will be used for the first sidebar filter</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">lookup = session.table(&#39;LOOKUP&#39;)
industry = lookup.select(&#39;INDUSTRY&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the selected industry, key variables are generated for added context to the standing data and filtering the points of interest dataset. The user selects the chosen industry from the sidebar, which then assign the variables</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">#sidebar
with st.sidebar:
    st.image(image)
    choice = st.radio(&#39;select industry&#39;, industry)
    lookup = lookup.filter(col(&#39;INDUSTRY&#39;)==choice)
    lookup = lookup.with_column(&#39;IND&#39;,array_to_string(&#39;IND&#39;,lit(&#39;,&#39;)))
    lookup = lookup.with_column(&#39;IND2&#39;,array_to_string(&#39;IND2&#39;,lit(&#39;,&#39;)))
    
    lookuppd = lookup.to_pandas()


</code></pre>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">#assign variables

pa = lookuppd.PA.iloc[0]
pb = lookuppd.PB.iloc[0]
pc = lookuppd.PC.iloc[0]
ind = lookuppd.IND.iloc[0]
ind2 = lookuppd.IND2.iloc[0]
ctype = json.loads(lookuppd.CTYPE.iloc[0])
stype = json.loads(lookuppd.STYPE.iloc[0])

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Vehicle Type Dropdown</strong></p>
<p>These vehicle types will be assigned to each of the 3 vehicles. These will be configured by the user.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">method =[
             &#39;driving-car&#39;,

<p><strong>Locations Dataset</strong> Here, a Snowpark Dataframe is created from the previously configured places dataset.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_f = session.table(&#39;places&#39;)

</code></pre>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_f = places_f.select(&#39;GEOMETRY&#39;,call_function(&#39;ST_X&#39;,

                                  col(&#39;GEOMETRY&#39;).alias(&#39;POINT&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Cortex map filter</strong></p>
<p>This is where Cortex is used to filter the places dataset. The prompt is asking the model to ‘give me the Latitude an Longitude which centers the following place.&#39; The ‘following place&#39; is a free text field which the user enters such as: the Statue of Liberty, or London, or Heathrow Airport. They enter whatever they like and cortex will try and make sense of it. The user also chooses an LLM model (I have found mistral-large2 works very well) and a distance. Different LLMs produce varying results of accuracy. For better accuracy, perhaps use Cortex Fine Tuning to load good examples into the model - such as the Overture Points of Interest itself. I found that mistral large 2 produced the result accuracy I needed without fine tuning. The distance is not really used for the LLM, but is used later to filter out potential distributors by straight line distance.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">with st.sidebar:
    st.markdown(&#39;##### Cortex Powered Map Filter&#39;)
    st.info(prompt)
    model = st.selectbox(&#39;Choose Model:&#39;,[&#39;reka-flash&#39;,&#39;mistral-large2&#39;],1)
    place = st.text_input(&#39;Choose Input&#39;,&#39;Heathrow Airport&#39;)
    distance = st.number_input(&#39;Distance from location in KM&#39;,1,300,5)

</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to do some prompt engineering. Below is the initial prompt to work with.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">prompt = (&#39;give me the LAT and LON which centers the following place&#39;)

</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that the prompt feed the LLM and return the results to the LLM in the correct format. However, further engineering will be needed before we get reliably good results.</p>
<p>I engineered the prompt by adding text to the prompts such as &#39; return 3 value which are as follows.... and ‘use the following json template&#39;. This is to ensure that what is returned is very likely to be in the format that I would expect.</p>
<p>The results are returned as a single string which is simply converted to json by using the ‘parse_json&#39; function. You will note that before the json is parsed I removed characters that are sometimes generated in order to return the resulting json as markdown. This is great for display purposes but not so great if I only want the json. The replace function removes these characters if they exist.</p>
<p>Once parsed, I used standard geo and semi structured features in Snowflake to calculate points, present results in a structured form and order the returned results by distance.</p>
<p>This has all been wrapped with a function called choose_place(place,model,distance).</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">prompt = (&#39;give me the LAT and LON which centers the following place&#39;)

<p>We will next add a new layer which will show all industry related industry suggestions that are within X distance of the blue spot.</p>
<p><strong>Searching the data for the right type of place (The What).</strong></p>
<p>We will search the ‘what&#39; by using the SEARCH function. This will search multiple columns within the same row to see if it matches the keywords stated in the industry lookup table. The industry must match the one which the user selected earlier. You will note that this search is being repeated twice - this is to search for two different concepts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search one must contain one of these words:<ul>
<li>hospital</li>
<li>health</li>
<li>pharmaceutical</li>
<li>drug</li>
<li>healthcare</li>
<li>pharmacy</li>
<li>surgical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From the results of search 1, search 2 must contain one of these words:<ul>
<li>supplies</li>
<li>warehouse</li>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="choose depot" src="img/ec2b2dab4034f430.png"></p>
<p><strong>Job Template</strong></p>
<p>The job template is joined to the the industry lookups for provide context to the types of goods being delivered. we will call this ‘time slots&#39;</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">time_slots = session.table(&#39;JOB_TEMPLATE&#39;)
pa = time_slots.filter(col(&#39;PRODUCT&#39;)==&#39;pa&#39;).join(lookup.select(&#39;PA&#39;))

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Customer Catchment Generation</strong></p>
<p>Now we need to generate another dataset - this time for potential customers which are located within catchment of a chosen depot.  The user will define the catchment based on a drive time.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">range_minutes = st.number_input(&#39;Order Acceptance catchment time:&#39;,0,120,20)

</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="catchment_time" src="img/a40e2e70bf8ef581.png"></p>
<p>We will now focus on filtering a new point of interest dataset by drive time. This dataset will simulate typical customers within the catchment. For this, we will leverage the ‘isochrone&#39; function which calls the open route service api to build a catchment polygon.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">isochrone = session.create_dataframe([{&#39;LON&#39;:start_1[0], 
                      &#39;LAT&#39;:start_1[1], 
                      &#39;METHOD&#39;:smethod,
                      &#39;RANGE_MINS&#39;:range_minutes}])
st.write(isochrone)
        
isochrone = isochrone.select(call_function(&#39;UTILS.ISOCHRONES&#39;,
                          (col(&#39;METHOD&#39;), 
                           col(&#39;LON&#39;), 
                           col(&#39;LAT&#39;), 
                           col(&#39;RANGE_MINS&#39;))).alias(&#39;ISOCHRONE&#39;))

isochrone2 = isochrone.select(to_geography(col(&#39;ISOCHRONE&#39;)[&#39;features&#39;][0][&#39;geometry&#39;]).alias(&#39;GEO&#39;)).cache_result()

</code></pre>
<p>You will see that after calling the isochrone function, we then join the resulting polygon dataset to the point of interest dataset using ‘ST_WITHIN&#39;. This ensures only jobs will be created within the catchment area of the polygon.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Type Filter</strong></p>
<p>Now lets filter <strong>‘the what&#39;</strong> on the customer dataset. We have all points of interests around the catchment of a depo, however, we have not specified what type of organisations these customers are. This is what the next drop down list is for. The user will pick the type of customer which is relevant to the industry. This example filter selection below will only retain organisations which are categorised as hospitals, dentists and pharmacies. Because the categories are in two fields, we will use the <strong>SEARCH</strong> function again.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="cust_type_filter" src="img/d5b4cbe174f9c961.png"></p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_2 = places_f.filter(expr(f&#39;&#39;&#39;search((CATEGORY,ALTERNATE,NAME),
                                &#39;{&#34; &#34;.join(customer_type)}&#39;,
                                analyzer=&gt;&#39;DEFAULT_ANALYZER&#39;)&#39;&#39;&#39;))

</code></pre>
<p>We will limit our customer results to match the number of ‘time slots&#39; we have created from the job template, and generate a sample of the results.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_2 = places_2.join(isochrone2,
  call_function(&#39;ST_WITHIN&#39;,
  places_2[&#39;POINT&#39;],
  isochrone2[&#39;GEO&#39;])).sample(0.5).limit(time_slots.count()).cache_result()

</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will create a row number after ordering the sample by a random number. This row number will effectively become our unique <strong>‘consignment number&#39;</strong> which will be used in the optimisation service.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">window_spec = Window.order_by(random())
places_2 = places_2.with_column(&#39;ID&#39;,row_number().over(window_spec))
places_2 = places_2.join(time_slots,&#39;ID&#39;)

</code></pre>
<p>Next we will join to the time slots by ‘ID&#39; which has been randomly assigned to <strong>‘our customers&#39;</strong>.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_2 = places_2.join(time_slots,&#39;ID&#39;)

</code></pre>
<p>Now we will format the table in to presentable jobs. This will assign skills, time slots and capacity requirements.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">places_2_table = places_2.select(&#39;ID&#39;,

<p><strong>The Vehicles</strong> The example I have created, is an example of only 3 vehicles at pre defined skill levels.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="vehicle_config" src="img/5b9967032fd140d9.png"></p>
<p>The vehicle location is then Aligned to the previously selected depot. In reality, vehicles might have varying start destinations - however, for simplicity all vehicle starting points are the same.</p>

<p>Construct each configurable vehicle. Below is an example of one of the vehicles. You will see that we are converting the start and end time of each vehicle to seconds - likewise for the customers, the agreed delivery times for the optimisation service to work are also in seconds.</p>

<p>For further formatting - when the job results are returned after going through the optimisation service, it will be nice to clearly see what vehicles are aligned to what job. This detail is added to the dataframe which gives data driven colour coding.</p>

<p>As described in the route optimisation function, the output will give steps for the journey along with other measures such as duration and what vehicle will be assigned. </p>
<p>The <strong>directions API</strong> will then be used to get detailed instructions for each step.</p>

<p>Two layers are created for the visualisation - one for the line paths and the other for the drop offs. The layers have been generated by a python function in order to reuse the code for each vehicle. This is so i can show a vehicle plan each containing an independant map within each tab.</p>

<p>Below you can see an example of all three vehicles travelling around Paris to drop goods off. This is combining points and line string layers for each vehicle as well as the isochrone layer.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="map with tabs" src="img/9f89f7ad55031a45.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Considerations</h3>
<p>The Job details may plot routes outside the agreed time.  The Demo has only vehicles where each vehicle has a unique skill.  We will need more vehicles / less skills to prevent these violations.</p>
<p>The app is confined to a B2B model as we do not have public names and addresses of B2C consumers.  If a B2C simulator is needed, then an alternative ‘customer&#39; dataset other than the ‘places&#39; dataset is needed.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So you will now see that by combining AI, freely accessible points of interests, easy to use geospatial functions, the ability to securely call the open route service and the powers of Streamlit in Snowflake - creating innovative geospatial applications  is entirely possible.</p>
<p>Snowflake provides powerful solutions when you bring Snowflake&#39;s advanced analytics, Cortex, Snowpark and Streamlit&#39;s visualization capabilities together.  Also, by leveraging the open route service (or even an alternative provider such as the Carto Toolbox) using external integrations provides another level of geospatial capabilites such as route optimisation, directions and isochrones.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You Learned</h2>
<p>You will have learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use Snowflake Cortex can be used as a location filter, which can filter a comprehensive point of interest dataset to anywhere in the world.</li>
<li>Use text based Search capabilities for advanced filtering which adds accurate context to a simulation</li>
<li>How to utilise Pydeck to create a multi layered map</li>
<li>Leverage the open route service to create the following<ul>
<li>isochrones (catchements) based on drive time</li>
<li>Simple Directions and Directions which include waypoints</li>
<li>Route Optimisations</li>
</ul>
