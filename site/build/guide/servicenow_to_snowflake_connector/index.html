        <p>Use this quickstart lab to configure and understand the Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow® using the Snowsight wizard, select some tables, ingest data, and run an example query. This quickstart is not meant to be exhaustive. Please check the <a href="https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/connectors/servicenow/servicenow-index.html" target="_blank">Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow® documentation</a> for full functionality and limitations.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="now" src="img/694ec19cfae3fbef.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p> Note: This quickstart assumes you do not have a ServiceNow® account, so it guides you through the steps of creating a developer account. Of course, if you do have a Servicenow® account, please feel free to try it out, with the caveat that, at the time of this writing, the connector is in public preview and therefore the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/legal/preview-terms-of-service/" target="_blank">preview terms</a> apply.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Set up the ServiceNow® Developer Instance" duration="5">
        <p>If you do not want to test this connector on your ServiceNow® account, no problem, this step explains how to set up a developer instance!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com" target="_blank">ServiceNow® developer website</a>, and create a developer user.</li>
<li>Log on to the developer website with your newly created user and select <strong>Create an Instance</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose an instance type. You receive an email with your instance URL, and admin user and password.</li>
</ol>
<p>Deployment is usually pretty quick, around five minutes. But, while you wait, let&#39;s go to the next step and configure Snowflake!</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Create and set up the Snowflake Account" duration="1">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Create the Snowflake Account</h2>
<p>If you do not have a Snowflake account, no problem, you can get a free trial  at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/" target="_blank">snowflake.com</a>. Select <strong>Start for Free</strong> and follow the instructions.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Accept the Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log on to your Snowflake account through the Snowsight web interface and change to the <strong>ORGADMIN</strong> role.</li>
<li>Select &#34;Admin -&gt; Billing &amp; Terms&#34;.</li>
<li>In the &#34;Snowflake Marketplace&#34; section, review the Consumer Terms of Service.</li>
<li>If you agree to the terms, select &#34;Accept Terms &amp; Conditions&#34;.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Set up a Virtual Warehouse</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll need some compute for the connector installation process, so let&#39;s set up a virtual warehouse to do that.</p>
<p>Change to the <strong>ACCOUNTADMIN</strong> role.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to Admin -&gt; Warehouses and select <strong>+ Warehouse</strong>.</li>
<li>Name the virtual warehouse <strong>CONNECTOR_UI_WH</strong>, size XS, and, leaving the defaults, select <strong>Create Warehouse</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Install the ServiceNow® connector</h2>
<p>The connector, the first of its kind to be deployed on Snowflake&#39;s <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/" target="_blank">Native App Framework</a>, is delivered through the Snowflake Marketplace, and is available to all Snowflake customers instantly. Once chosen, it is installed into your account as an application with several views, and stored procedures.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the left menu select <strong>Data Products</strong> and then <strong>Marketplace</strong>.</li>
<li>In the search window, enter <strong>ServiceNow</strong> and select the tile.</li>
<li>Review the business needs and usage samples.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Get</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the warehouse you created above, <strong>CONNECTOR_UI_WH</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong>.</li>
<li>For this lab, leave the default name for the installation database, <strong>Snowflake_Connector_for_ServiceNow</strong>. Do not select any additional roles.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Get</strong>. You receive the following message, <strong>Snowflake Connector for SeviceNow is now ready to use in your account.</strong><img alt="Get ServiceNow Connector" src="img/3c42c8df4d5a6863.png"></li>
<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>. We will manage it in the next section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s check that the connector was installed. From Snowsight, go to <strong>Data Products</strong> -&gt; <strong>Apps</strong>. You will see a new installed application with the name <strong>Snowflake_Connector_for_ServiceNow</strong>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="installed_app" src="img/57316640b1c5d446.png"></p>
<p>Take a look at its public schema in <strong>Data -&gt; Databases</strong> to see what views and procedures are available.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="installed_db" src="img/45aeb9b81a265492.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Complete all the prerequisites" duration="2">
        <p>Launch the Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow® from the <strong>Data Products</strong> -&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> -&gt; <strong>Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow</strong>. You will be presented the list of tasks that need to be done before you&#39;ll be able to start the ingestion of the data. Please read the descriptions carefully and complete them one by one.</p>
<p>One of the last steps asks you to create application registry if you want to use OAuth2 authentication. Let&#39;s focus on it for a while.</p>
<p>Please have two tabs in your browser open for the next part, as you will have to copy some data from Snowflake to ServiceNow®.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Snowflake side, we want the connector to generate the <strong>redirect URL</strong> which we will paste into the Application Registry, and</li>
<li>From the ServiceNow® side we want the Application Registry to provide the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>secret</strong>, which we then paste into Snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>On the Snowflake hand</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy the redirect URL. You will need it in the next section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, open a new tab in your browser (without closing the above), and follow the steps in the next section.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>On the ServiceNow® other hand</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log on to your ServiceNow® developer instance.</li>
<li>From the main page, select <strong>All</strong> and search <strong>Application Registry</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Application Registry" src="img/698362f0dc7e6ebd.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select <strong>New</strong> in the upper right-hand side of the window.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients</strong>.</li>
<li>Give the endpoint a name, such as <strong>Snowflake_connector</strong>. Leave the client secret blank. This will autofill.</li>
<li>Paste in the redirect URL that was generated on the Snowflake hand.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Oauth" src="img/3924ac3a57dc025b.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select <strong>Submit</strong>. The window closes.</li>
<li>Select the registry you just created to re-open it.</li>
<li>Note that the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client secret</strong> are auto-generated.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t close the ServiceNow® browser tab or store the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client secret</strong> in some safe place, they will be needed later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, time to jump back to the Snowflake configuration tab.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Configure the Connector" duration="1">
        <p>When all the preparation tasks are done, move to the next step by clicking <strong>Start configuration</strong></p>
<p>This displays the Configure screen. By default, the fields are set to the names of objects that are created when you configure the connector. You can also provide names of existing objects.</p>
<p>The virtual warehouse that you need to choose now will be used by the connector for background data ingestion processes.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="default config" src="img/d37819a2ebf1f4bd.png"></p>

<p>Select <strong>Configure</strong>. It can take a few minutes for the configuration process to complete, and you will be moved to the next step.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p> Watch out!!! The created warehouse is created as a <strong>Large</strong> and with a auto suspension after 10 minutes. So this means, if you set to refresh every hour, the Large warehouse (8 credits/hour) will wake up for a minimum of 10 minutes every hour.  For this lab, you don&#39;t need all the power! Go to Admin -&gt; Warehouses -&gt; SERVICENOW_WAREHOUSE -&gt; ... &gt; Edit, and change this to an XSMALL, and the auto timeout to one minute. In a real-life use case, a Large warehouse size is often needed.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="special"><p> Absolutely attach a resource monitor to the SERVICENOW_WAREHOUSE. Go to Admin-&gt;Resource Monitors-&gt;+ Resource Monitor, and create a warehouse resource monitor: <img alt="resource monitor" src="img/86388c99166dee89.png"></p>

        <ol type="1">
<li>Select <strong>OAuth2</strong> as an authentication method</li>
<li>Fill in the ServiceNow® instance details. This is the first part of the ServiceNow® URL for your ServiceNow® account, <strong>without </strong><em>https://</em> protocol and the trailing <em>service-now.com</em>.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Configure deletions sync" duration="1">
        <p>If you want not only inserts and updates, but also deletes to be synchronized to Snowflake, you have to provide name of the journal table. By default ServiceNow® uses <code>sys_audit_delete</code> table to store information about deleted records so feel free to provide this name. If you don&#39;t care about deletes, you can leave this field empty.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="validate_source" src="img/bb4c0e3901a3b388.png"></p>
<p>Select <strong>Validate</strong> to check if the connector is able to connect to the source system and has access to all the required tables. It can take a few minutes for the process to complete. When it&#39;s done, please select <strong>Define data to sync</strong> to select tables for the ingestion.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Select ServiceNow® Tables" duration="1">
        <aside class="warning"><p> A couple of things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The connector can only ingest tables with <strong>sys_id</strong> columns present.</li>
<li>ServiceNow® views are not supported. Instead of ingesting these views, you should synchronize all tables for the underlying view and join the synchronized tables in Snowflake.</li>
<li>Incremental updates occur only for tables with <strong>sys_updated_on</strong> or <strong>sys_created_on</strong> columns.</li>
<li>For tables that do not have sys_updated_on or sys_created_on columns, the connector uses <strong>truncate and load</strong> mode. In this mode, the table is always ingested using the initial load approach, and newly ingested data replaces the old data.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the <strong>Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow</strong> window, on the top bar, select <strong>Data Sync</strong>.</li>
<li>To be able to run our test query later, we need to ingest a couple of tables. From the search window enter <strong>incident</strong> and check the box next to it and choose a 30 minute sync time.</li>
<li>To choose other tables, clear the search, put the table name and select the checkbox. Do this at least for <strong>task</strong> table.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="special"><p> Hint: Clear the search fields, and then select the title <strong>Status</strong> to sort and show all the tables you selected.</p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Select" src="img/c5cb5e84c838a1ed.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select <strong>Start Sync</strong>. The select windows closes and you get the message &#34;Syncing Data&#34; from the main Connector window. In addition to the tables you choose, three system tables will also be loaded. These are necessary to build the views on the raw data: sys_dictionary, sys_db_object, and sys_glide_object.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load" src="img/ca1da2b7fbcbaf4b.png"></p>
<p>You receive a message indicating success. It appears once at least one table has been fully ingested.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="success" src="img/927158cdb2464345.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p> Don&#39;t stop the ingest too quickly. Make sure the views are built in the destination database first.</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Connector Monitoring" duration="2">
        <p>Let&#39;s open a worksheet to check what&#39;s going on inside the connector. Here are some examples of SQL queries you can execute to get monitoring information:</p>
<pre><code language="language-SQL" class="language-SQL">// Get general information about all ingestions
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTOR_FOR_SERVICENOW.public.connector_stats;

// Search for information about particular table ingestions
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTOR_FOR_SERVICENOW.public.connector_stats WHERE table_name = &#39;&lt;table_name&gt;&#39;;

// Check connector configuration
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTOR_FOR_SERVICENOW.public.connector_configuration;

// Calculate ingested data volume
SELECT
    table_name,
    sum(ingested_rows) AS row_count
FROM SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTOR_FOR_SERVICENOW.public.connector_stats
GROUP BY table_name
ORDER BY table_name;

// General connector statistics
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTOR_FOR_SERVICENOW.public.connector_overview;
</code></pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Configuring access to the ingested data" duration="1">
        <p>The connector exposes an application role named <code>DATA_READER</code>. It has read access to all the ingested data in the destination schema. It&#39;s automatically granted to the role provided during the <strong>Configure</strong> step of the installation process. It was named <code>SERVICE_NOW_RESOURCES_PROVIDER</code> in the screenshot earlier in this guide. You can grant either application role or account role further if needed.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Query the Data" duration="1">
        <p>Check out the tables that the connector has created under the destination schema of the destination database. For each table in ServiceNow® that is configured for synchronization, the connector creates the following table and views:</p>
<ul>
<li>A table with the same name that contains the data in raw form, where each record is contained in a single VARIANT column.</li>
<li>A view named table_name__view that contains the data in flattened form, where the view contains a column for each column in the original table and a row for each record that is present in the original table.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p> Warning! After you start the connector, it takes for the views to be created. The creation of the views relies on data in the ServiceNow® sys_db_object, sys_dictionary and sys_glide_object tables. The connector loads metadata from these ServiceNow® tables after you enable any table for synchronization. It can take some time for the connector to load this metadata. Do not stop the warehouse during this time!</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>A view named table_name__view_with_deleted that contains the same data as table_name__view as well as rows for records that have been deleted in ServiceNow®.</li>
<li>A table table_name__event_log that contains the history of changes fetched by the connector from ServiceNow®.</li>
</ul>
