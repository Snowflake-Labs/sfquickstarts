      <google-codelab-step label="Conclusion &amp; Next Steps" duration="4">
        <p>Visually guided database modeling can help an enterprise data team make sense of, and accelerate database development. In this Quickstart, we followed a simple development workflow: from creating and instantiating a new Snowflake project and schema, to making changes, all the way to deployment. However, the benefits of a centralized modeling tool extend well beyond the role of a developer.</p>
<p>Whether it&#39;s a project manager using <strong>Compare Revisions</strong> to track changes, a business user familiarizing themselves with a previously-unknown datamart through a relational diagram, or a new team-member becoming appraised of an organization through <strong>Database Documentation</strong> - doing this in a single tool and a coordinated fashion makes everyone&#39;s job easier and ensures consistency throughout.</p>
