<h2 is-upgraded>Step 3: Set Up External Volume and Catalog Integration</h2>
<p>We will be using a dataset from a public S3 bucket for this lab. The bucket has been provisioned so that any Snowflake account can access the dataset.

<p>Let&#39;s get familiar with Coalesce by walking through the basic components of the user interface.</p>
<p>​​Once you&#39;ve activated your Coalesce trial account and logged in, you will land in your Projects dashboard. Projects are a useful way of organizing your development work by a specific purpose or team goal, similar to how folders help you organize documents in Google Drive.</p>

A DAG is a conceptual representation of the nodes within your data pipeline and their relationships to and dependencies on each other.</li>

Using Coalesce Marketplace, we can easily install Iceberg nodes that will be immediately available to use, which will allow us to read in and manage data in Iceberg table format. Additionally, we will be working with a dataset that contains multiple languages in the form of call transcripts. We want to explore these transcripts further using Cortex LLM functions, so we&#39;ll need to use the Cortex package from Coalesce Marketplace.</p>

        <p>Now that we have prepared the call transcript data by creating nodes for each language, we can now process the language of the transcripts and translate them into a singular language. In this case, English.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the STG_CALL_TRANSCRIPTS_GERMAN node and hold the Shift key and select the STG_CALL_TRANSCRIPTS_FRENCH node. Right click on either node and navigate to Add Node. You should see the Cortex package that you installed from the Coalesce Marketplace. By hovering over the Cortex package, you should see the available nodes. Select Cortex Functions. This will add the Cortex Function node to each STG node.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="image44" src="img/b5790b1534203ca3.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>You now need to configure the Cortex Function nodes to translate the language of the transcripts. Double click on the LLM_CALL_TRANSCRIPTS_GERMAN node to open it.</li>

<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>With the TRANSLATE toggle on, In the column name selector dropdown, you need to select the column to translate. In this case, the TRANSCRIPT column.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Now that you have selected the column that will be translated, you will pass through the language you wish to translate from and the language you wish to translate to, into the translation text box.

<li>Finally, you will configure the language code for what you wish to translate the language of the transcript column from to the language you wish to translate to. In this case, the language code is as follows:‘fr&#39;, ‘en&#39;</li>
</ol>
<p>Any values in the transcript field which do not match the language being translated from will be ignored. In this case, there are both French and English language values in the TRANSCRIPT field. Because the English values are not in French, they will automatically pass through as their original values. Since those values are already in English, they don&#39;t require any additional processing.</p>

        <p>Now that we have all of our translated transcript data in the same table, we can now begin our analysis and extract insights from the data. For the sake of our use case, we want to perform a sentiment analysis on the Transcript, to understand how each of our customers felt during their interaction with our company.</p>
<p>Additionally, our call center reps are trained to ask for the customer&#39;s name when someone calls into the call center. Since we have this information, we want to extract the customer name from the transcript so we can associate the sentiment score with our customer to better understand their experience with our company.</p>
