<p>In the gaming industry, Player data is often fragmented across multiple sources, including event streams, purchase histories, and platform-specific behaviors. This disjointed data makes it challenging for gaming companies and key personas such as marketing and product to gain a holistic understanding of individual players and overall game performance. In this demo we will create a &#34;Player 360&#34; dashboard, which integrates and visualizes diverse player data sources into a single, dynamic &#34;Player Card.&#34; This card will offer insights into player activity &amp; interactions (behavior, buying habits, etc), and this preliminary use case will potentially show the highest risk for churn players. Similarly, we will create a &#34;Game 360&#34; dashboard which integrates games-level insights across the playerbase, focusing on key KPIs, metrics, and overall user behavior.</p>
<p>By aggregating these data streams in a unified system and leveraging Snowflake features such as Snowpark ML, Snowflake Notebooks, and Streamlit in Snowflake, companies can more effectively understand player/customer journeys, tailor in-game experiences, and optimize monetization strategies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Review KPIs for the overall game performance dataset.</li>
<li>In <code>Static Demographics</code> section, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for key demographics (Location, Gender, Age, Rank) and display population segment breakdown.<ul>
<li>Analyze churn rates across different demographic segments.</li>
<li>Assess correlations between different variables using the Correlation Matrix.</li>
<li>Investigate the distribution of churned vs non-churned users based on average metrics, noting that churned users are more centralized.</li>
<li>Identify that churned users tend to spend a significant amount (make many purchases) before churning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <code>Static Game Metrics</code>, zoom into specific time periods for deeper analysis of key KPIs.<ul>
<li>Filter by time period (e.g., January 1, 2023) to investigate dips in all metrics and recognize this as an inflection point for cohort LTV (Lifetime Value).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the sidebar, apply filters to isolate player segment behavior:<ul>
<li>Poland</li>
<li>Casual Player Type</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filter by time range to analyze the metrics of this player segment at various intervals before they churned.</li>
<li>Transition to <code>Dynamic Demographics</code> and compare the correlation matrix, noting significant differences (e.g., red flags in correlations).</li>
<li>In <code>Dynamic Churnlikelihood</code> Extract the demographic features most relevant for predicting churn.</li>
<li>In the <code>Filtered Dataframe</code> Sort the data and export the filtered dataset.</li>

        <p>This demo has showcased how Snowflake enables the creation of unified &#34;Player 360&#34; and &#34;Game 360&#34; dashboards by aggregating diverse player and game data streams into a single, actionable view. Through the use of Snowpark ML, Snowflake Notebooks, and Streamlit, we&#39;ve demonstrated how companies can leverage these integrated tools to gain deeper insights into player behavior, churn risk, and overall game performance. By consolidating data sources and applying advanced analytics, gaming companies can optimize player engagement and refine monetization strategies, all within a governed and scalable environment.</p>
