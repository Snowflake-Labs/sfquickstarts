        <p>In this guide, you will learn how to build a personalized movie recommendation chatbot using <a href="https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZBN5P0/kumo-ai-kumo?search=kumo" target="_blank">Kumo (as a Snowflake Native App</a>), Snowflake&#39;s Cortex Search Service, Cortex AI, and Streamli<strong>t</strong>. This chatbot enhances the streaming experience by providing personalized movie recommendations based on user viewing history and movie relationships.</p>
<p>Specifically, you will learn how to develop a chatbot that can answer the following types of queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item-to-User Predictions</strong> – Personalized recommendations based on a user&#39;s past viewing history (e.g., <em>&#34;What should I watch next?&#34;</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Item-to-Item Predictions</strong> – Identifying similar movies based on shared genres, themes, or cast members (e.g., <em>&#34;Is this movie similar to that one?&#34;</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>By handling both types of queries, the chatbot enhances content discovery, helping users navigate vast streaming libraries more efficiently.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Kumo?</h2>
<p>Kumo is an advanced ML platform that leverages <a href="https://kumo.ai/research/graph-neural-networks-gnn/" target="_blank"><em>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</em></a> to deliver predictions directly from your Snowflake relational data. Kumo ML models are powered by a GNN architecture, inspired by several academic papers in recent history. Data scientists simply need to write a <a href="https://kumo.ai/docs/predictive-query" target="_blank"><em>predictive query</em></a>, and then the Kumo platform will automatically craft the proper neural architecture for their data. As a result of this approach, Kumo is able to achieve great predictive performance out of the box, across a wide range of challenging scenarios.</p>
<p>Kumo simplifies the end-to-end ML process by eliminating the need for extensive data preparation, model tuning, and feature engineering, allowing data scientists to focus on generating valuable predictions and insights.</p>

<p>To improve readability, we modified the movies table by</p>
<p>•	Splitting the title and year into separate columns.</p>
<p>•	Reformatting genres from pipe-separated to comma-separated.</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.NEW_MOVIES_TABLE AS
SELECT 
    MOVIEID,
    TRIM(SUBSTR(TITLE, 1, LENGTH(TITLE) - 6)) AS TITLE_ONLY, 
    CAST(SUBSTR(TITLE, LENGTH(TITLE) - 4, 4) AS INT) AS YEAR, 
    REPLACE(GENRE, &#39;|&#39;, &#39;,&#39;) AS GENRE_MODIFIED

      <google-codelab-step label="Run Batch Prediction Workflows in Kumo" duration="10">
        <p>We will generate movie recommendations using two batch prediction workflows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>item-to-user</strong> predictions (personalized recommendations)</li>
<li><strong>item-to-item</strong> predictions (finding similar movies)</li>
</ol>
<p>These predictions will be stored in Snowflake and used to power the chatbot.</p>
<p>While the train-validation loop is not covered here, it plays a key role in building reliable link prediction models and refining recommendations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Item-to-User</h2>
<p>For the item-to-user batch prediction workflow, your goal is to predict top 25 movies a user is likely to rate (watch) in the next 30 days. Using Kumo, construct a graph where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent users and movies</li>
<li><strong>Edges</strong> represent user-movie interactions (ratings)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="img" src="img/4ef4e7b2bf6988d2.png"> You can then run the following Predictive Query:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT LIST_DISTINCT(RATINGS.MOVIEID, 0, 30, days)
RANK TOP 25
FOR EACH USERS.USERID
</code></pre>
<p>After running this Predictive Query and a batch prediction workflow, you&#39;ll get two outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictions:</strong> Top 25 movie recommendations per user</li>
<li><strong>Embeddings:</strong> Feature representations for each user and movie</li>
</ul>
<p>These outputs can be exported into two Snowflake tables directly from Kumo.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/5bd58a08cf9ee43.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/1f87a75c002234bf.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Item-to-Item</h2>
<p>For the item-to-item batch prediction workflow, your goal is to generate the top 10 similar movies for each movie by analyzing co-occurrence patterns (movies rated by the same user on the same day).</p>
<p>First, create a co-occurrence table in Snowflake:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.RATING_PAIRS AS
SELECT
  A.USERID,
  A.MOVIEID AS MOVIEID1,
  A.RATING AS RATING1,
  B.MOVIEID AS MOVIEID2,
  B.RATING AS RATING2,
  CAST(A.TIMESTAMP AS DATE) AS REVIEW_DATE
FROM
  KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.RATINGS A
JOIN
  KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.RATINGS B
ON
  A.USERID = B.USERID -- Same user
  AND CAST(A.TIMESTAMP AS DATE) = CAST(B.TIMESTAMP AS DATE) -- Same date
  AND A.MOVIEID &lt; B.MOVIEID -- To avoid duplicates and self-pairs
</code></pre>
<p>Using this table and two copies of the Movies table, construct a graph connecting related movies.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/5978df7b86ddb552.png"></p>
<p>You can then run the following Predictive Query:</p>
<pre><code>PREDICT LIST_DISTINCT(RATING_PAIRS.MOVIEID2, 0, 30)
RANK TOP 10
FOR EACH MOVIES.MOVIEID
</code></pre>
<p>After running this Predictive Query and obtaining a batch prediction workflow, you will get two outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictions:</strong> Top 10 movie predictions for each movie in the left hand side table over the next 30 days</li>
<li><strong>Embeddings:</strong> Two sets of movie embeddings for both the left hand side and right hand side tables</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in the item to user workflow, these results can be exported to two Snowflake tables directly from Kumo.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/c73d3e2042fcdd29.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img" src="img/a67eaca221a4420f.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Store Predictions in Snowflake" duration="5">
        <p>At this stage, you should have four tables stored in Snowflake: item-to-user predictions, item-to-user embeddings, item-to-item predictions, and item-to-item embeddings. You also have the original movies and users tables from the MovieLens dataset that includes information about the movies and users themselves. In this demo, you will mainly be focusing on the movies, users, and the two predictions tables.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the best search results, you will need to restructure our tables. The following walks through the data transformations applied on these tables.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>User Table</h2>
<p>The original Users table contains multiple columns, such as age group, occupation code, etc. To simplify searches, you will consolidate this information into a single table with two columns: USER_ID and USER_INFO. The USER_INFO column will combine details from the original columns into a single descriptive entry.</p>
<p>For instance, for an entry like this on the original customer table:</p>
<pre><code>*{&#34;USERID&#34;: 1, &#34;GENDER&#34;:&#34;F&#34;, &#34;AGEGROUP&#34;:1, &#34;OCCUPATIONCODE&#34;:10, &#34;ZIPCODE&#34;: 48067}*
</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding entry in the new table would be:</p>
<pre><code>*{&#34;USER_ID&#34;:1,&#34;USER_INFO&#34;:&#34;Customer with ID 1 is a female. They are uner 18 years old. Their occupation is K-12 student. Their zip code is &#39;48067&#39;&#34;}*
</code></pre>
<p>Use the following SQL command on a Snowflake worksheet to perform this transformation:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE KUMO_CHATBOT.PUBLIC.USER_INFO AS
SELECT 
    USERID AS USER_ID,
    CONCAT(
        &#39;Customer with ID &#39;, USERID, &#39; is a &#39;,
        CASE 
            WHEN GENDER = &#39;M&#39; THEN &#39;male&#39;
            WHEN GENDER = &#39;F&#39; THEN &#39;female&#39;
            ELSE &#39;unknown&#39;
        END,
        &#39;. They are &#39;,
        CASE 
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 1 THEN &#39;under 18 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 18 THEN &#39;18-24 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 25 THEN &#39;25-34 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 35 THEN &#39;35-44 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 45 THEN &#39;45-49 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 50 THEN &#39;50-55 years old&#39;
            WHEN AGEGROUP = 56 THEN &#39;56+ years old&#39;
            ELSE &#39;of an unknown age group&#39;
        END,
        &#39;. Their occupation is &#39;,
        CASE 
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 0 THEN &#39;other or not specified&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 1 THEN &#39;academic/educator&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 2 THEN &#39;artist&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 3 THEN &#39;clerical/admin&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 4 THEN &#39;college/grad student&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 5 THEN &#39;customer service&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 6 THEN &#39;doctor/health care&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 7 THEN &#39;executive/managerial&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 8 THEN &#39;farmer&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 9 THEN &#39;homemaker&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 10 THEN &#39;K-12 student&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 11 THEN &#39;lawyer&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 12 THEN &#39;programmer&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 13 THEN &#39;retired&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 14 THEN &#39;sales/marketing&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 15 THEN &#39;scientist&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 16 THEN &#39;self-employed&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 17 THEN &#39;technician/engineer&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 18 THEN &#39;tradesman/craftsman&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 19 THEN &#39;unemployed&#39;
            WHEN OCCUPATIONCODE = 20 THEN &#39;writer&#39;
            ELSE &#39;unknown&#39;
        END,
        &#39;. Their zip code is &#39;&#39;&#39;, ZIPCODE, &#39;&#39;&#39;.&#39;
    ) AS USER_INFO
FROM 
    KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.USERS;
</code></pre>
<p>The occupation code and age group mapping are describe in the README file of the MovieLens 1M dataset.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Movie Table</h2>
<p>The original Movies table contains multiple columns, such as Title and Genre. Similar to what you did with the customer table, consolidate this information into two columns: MOVIE_ID and MOVIE_INFO.</p>
<p>For instance, considering the following movie:</p>
<pre><code>*{&#34;MOVIEID&#34;: 1, &#34;TITLE&#34;:&#34;Toy Story&#34;, &#34;YEAR&#34;:1995, &#34;GENRE&#34;:&#34;Animation, Children&#39;s, Comedy&#34;}*
</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding entry in the new table would be:</p>
<pre><code>*{&#34;MOVIE_ID&#34;: 1, &#34;MOVIE_INFO&#34;: &#34;Movie 1 is called &#39;Toy Story&#39;. It is released in 1995. It is falls under Animation, Children&#39;s, Comedy genres&#34;}*
</code></pre>
<p>Use the following SQL command on a Snowflake worksheet to perform this transformation:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE KUMO_CHATBOT.PUBLIC.MOVIE_INFO AS
SELECT 
    MOVIEID AS MOVIE_ID,
    CONCAT(
        &#39;Movie &#39;, MOVIEID, &#39; is called &#39;&#39;&#39;, TITLE_ONLY, &#39;&#39;&#39;. It was released in &#39;, YEAR, 
        &#39;. It falls under &#39;, 
        GENRE_MODIFIED, 
        CASE 
            WHEN LENGTH(GENRE_MODIFIED) - LENGTH(REPLACE(GENRE_MODIFIED, &#39;,&#39;, &#39;&#39;)) = 0 THEN &#39; genre.&#39;
            ELSE &#39; genres.&#39;
        END
    ) AS MOVIE_INFO
FROM 
    KUMO_DB.MOVIELENS1M.NEW_MOVIES_TABLE;
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Item-to-User Predictions Table</h2>
<p>In a similar vein to the users and movies tables, you will structure this table into two columns: USER_ID and a PREDICTION_DETAILS</p>
<p>A sample entry would look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>*{&#34;USER_ID&#34;:1,&#34;PREDICTION_DETAILS&#34;: &#34;The 1st prediction for user 1 is movie 3897 with score 12.142295837. Movie 3897 is called &#39;Almost Famous&#39;. It was released in 2000. It falls under Comedy,Drama genres. The 2nd prediction for user 1 is movie 3578 with score 11.983965874. Movie 3578 is called &#39;Gladiator&#39;. It was released in 2000. It falls under Action, ... The 25th prediction for user 1 is ...&#34;}*
</code></pre>
<p>Use the following SQL command on a Snowflake worksheet to perform this transformation:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE KUMO_CHATBOT.PUBLIC.MOVIE2USER_PREDICTION_WITHDETAILS AS(

<p>The item-to-user search service queries two primary tables: <strong>item-to-user predictions</strong> and <strong>user information</strong>. It retrieves data by user_id from both tables, combines the results, and provides them as a unified output in the search service.</p>
<p>Use the following SQL code on a Snowflake worksheet to set up this service:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE KUMO_CHATBOT.PUBLIC.item_to_user_service
ON search_text
ATTRIBUTES ENTITY_TYPE, USER_ID
WAREHOUSE = WAREHOUSE_SMALL

      <google-codelab-step label="Classify Response" duration="5">
        <p>With the search services registered, the next step is to integrate it with Cortex AI and Streamlit.</p>
<p>The pipeline works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Classify the user query</strong> as either item-to-item or item-to-user.</li>
<li><strong>Call the appropriate search service</strong> based on the classification.</li>
<li><strong>Generate the final response</strong> using Cortex AI with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note Snowflake just released Snowflake Agents in public preview, which provides an agentic approach to orchestration. In this case we&#39;ll create the flow ourselves.</p>
<p>Below is the code to classify a given user query:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">def classify_query(model, query):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Generates classification for given query using the specified model.

        Args:
            model(str): The name of the model to use for classification
            prompt(str): The prompt to generate the classification for

        Returns:
            str: The generated classification
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    classification_prompt = f&#34;&#34;&#34;Please classify the given user query as either item to item
                                or item to user. If classifying as item to item, print &#34;ITEM&#34; with
                                no additional text, and no whitespace. If classifying as item to user, print &#34;CUSTOMER&#34;
                                with no additional text, and no whitespace. If the prompt involves a user id, it will be
                                an item to user prompt. If the prompt involves movie ids, it will be an
                                item to item prompt.
                                Here is the user query: {query}
                                Please return the appropriate classfication.

</code></pre>
<p>You will use a user-selected model to process and classify the query with the given prompt.</p>
<p>Once the classification is determined, the following logic is used to select the corresponding search service and generate a response:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">with st.chat_message(&#34;assistant&#34;, avatar=icons[&#34;assistant&#34;]):

                    selected_search = None
                generated_response =

        )
</code></pre>
<p>This logic maps the classification to the appropriate search service and creates a final prompt that incorporates the query context. The final prompt is then passed to the user-selected model to generate the response.</p>
<p>The final prompt is structured as followed:</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We ran two batch prediction workflows on Kumo, prepared the data with necessary preprocessing, created two search services to support a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, and integrated these components with Cortex AI and Streamlit to build a complete user interface.</p>
<p>By leveraging Kumo, Cortex AI, and Streamlit, we created an AI Movie Concierge that enhances streaming experiences with personalized and contextual recommendations.</p>
